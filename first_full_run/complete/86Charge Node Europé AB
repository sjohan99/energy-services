Charging means new revenues
Three smart reasons to offer charging
1. More revenue, less work
Offer charging and bill users in the same way as for parking. You choose the electricity surcharge, we take care of operations and customer payments.
2. More satisfied visitors
Visitors who leave fully charged will return. They’ll choose you instead of places without charging facilities.
3. Strengthen your brand. And save the environment.
By offering EV charging, you’re making a conscious, eco-friendly choice to help the transition to a fossil-free society.
Request an offer
Our scalable charging system
With our patent-pending charging system you enjoy worry-free ownership, a 10-year depreciation period and the lowest total cost.
Centralised charging technology
A single sturdy charging cabinet can charge up to 54 cars. Each parking bay only needs one charging socket with an output of up to 22 kW. The system can be scaled up to hundreds of charging points.
Minimal groundwork
With our stylish power bar solution, you’ll avoid cable laying and expensive groundwork.
Lower power requirement
With smart optimisation and output sharing, 35-63A (3-phase) is ample in large buildings. Fuse protection and load-balancing with your building are of course included.
Smart control
Our smart cloud services let you monitor access, operation and invoicing. Visitors control charging and our easy-to-use app makes payment simple.
Guaranteed, end-to-end solution
Our end-to-end solution includes planning, installation, operation and payment solutions, always with a 3-year warranty. You can bank on a service life of at least 20 years.
Super-smart, worry-free!

WOW
Don’t miss out on your EV charger grant
The climate leap initiative will be reintroduced for visitor chargers in public spaces and there is a new subsidy for non-public charging. The subsidies cover up to 50% of the investment.
Get in touch and we’ll tell you more and help you through the application process.
I’d really like your help!

Why you should choose us
Innovative and optimised
EVs rarely need to charge more than 2–3 hours. But in tenant-owner associations, they’re often parked for a long while, especially at night. Installing a charging box in every parking bay and maybe having to invest in a larger power supply cable from the mains is not particularly cost-effective.
Our innovative charging technology distributes available output from a central charging cabinet to the connected vehicles. Because charging is optimised for each EV’s parking time, charge requirement and battery capacity, up to 54 vehicles can share a single charging cabinet, and each vehicle can charge at up to 22 kW. What’s more, the system can be scaled up to hundreds of charging points.
Stylish and eco-friendly
Our solution only requires one charging socket for each parking bay. This allows the outlets to be neatly and discreetly integrated into your parking environment.
Because multiple vehicles share a single charging cabinet, investment costs, the amount of expensive materials and environmental impact are all reduced. The difference is enormous compared to conventional charging systems, where each parking bay requires its own charging box.
See customer installations
Durable and reliable
All sensitive electronics are separated from the charging sockets and brought together in a central charging cabinet with the highest IP Rating. The charging cabinets are manufactured in Sweden using standard components of very high quality. This makes for a reliable charging environment and a service life of more than 20 years. And for the sake of your peace of mind, all of our installations come with a 3-year warranty.

Our customer recommendations
”ESS Group and Ellery Beach House chose ChargeNode because the company understood us, our guests and our challenges right away. The system was impressive from day one and in our experience, they demonstrated a fundamentally genuine interest in the environment and in us as a company. A great combination that bodes well for a long-term partnership.”
Carl Lundgren
Sales Director & Partner
ESS Group
Here are more smart thinkers
Worthwhile questions
Can our electrical system handle charging?
Yes. Because our charging system’s output is optimised through load-balancing (3.0), it can be installed in all properties. This means our charging system will never overload the electrical system.
How do we install a ChargeNode charging system?
Our sturdy charging cabinets can be installed in many ways, both indoors and out. Many customers choose to install trunking, i.e. a hollow rail available in many colours that runs in front of the parking bays. This requires no ground works. The outlets can also be installed in lighting bollards or directly on walls / façades. Smart and stylish.
What else will your charging system need?
It will need hard-wire access to the internet and a 16 A or greater supply cable, depending on the rate of use.
Why should I choose the charging system from ChargeNode?
Well, how about a scalable charging solution with a long service life and depreciation time? A smaller power supply cable compared to conventional charging box solutions. And a super-smart charging system where sensitive electrical components are gathered together and protected in a sturdy charging cabinet. In an installation free from groundwork. And last but not least, minimal maintenance.
How do we (tenant-owner associations, companies, car parks etc.) bill our customers?
We can take care of all user billing. Users register their payment cards in our app and are then debited monthly or on each occasion they charge their vehicle. Easy peasy.
Choose between billing based on user consumption (number of kWh) and/or on a fixed price (standard) per month. If you prefer to look after billing yourself, invoice templates are available from our cloud service.

Good to know when you’re investing in EV charging
Commercial properties
As a property owner, what should I bear in mind?
We’ve made great technical advances and these days it’s easier and cheaper to install charging systems. More and more property owners are showcasing their pioneering credentials and contributing to a better climate by offering their tenants EV charging. The green factor plays a part in the choice of premises for many companies. We’re all aware that we must reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the Swedish vehicle park. Sweden’s property owners have an enormously important part to play in the transition to electrification. Investing in charging systems is the only way to go, not only business wise, but also in terms of the environment.
See our installations
Choosing the right connector.
Because different EVs have different connectors, it’s important to plan the type or types of charging connectors to offer. The EU has decided that the Type 2 connector will be the standard for normal and semi-fast charging. The CCS connector will be the standard for fast charging. Follow these guidelines and you can’t go wrong.
Prepare properly?
The right way to prepare for your investment in a super-smart charging system
Setting up a charging system is a simple process when done in the correct order. Planning, procurement, installation and maintenance. Before you begin the procurement process and apply for planning permission, you need to check the items below. If you need guidance, we’ll be happy to help.
Make sure everyone involved such as the landowner, parking companies and the municipality is in agreement.
Decide on the right charging speed and connectors. Also, consider profiling and peripheral equipment for the charging system.
Find the best place for the charging system. Consider who should have access.
Decide on how customers should have access to charging, e.g. via a mobile app, code or RFID tag. Or should they be open to the public?
Decide on how to take payment or if charging should be free.
And the weather?
If there’s one thing we have no control over in Sweden it’s the weather, and as you know it can get pretty cold here. That’s why we use equipment that is tested for our climate. And you avoid charging cables that have frozen stiff.
What to do when you apply for a grant to purchase an EV charging system.
The application must be signed by an authorised company signatory.
Once you have submitted a preliminary application, you have 12 months in which to complete the measures. Once the measures are completed, the final application must be submitted within 3 months.
You can apply for the grant before or after the installation is completed. If the application is made after the installation is completed, it must be lodged with the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency within six months of the installation’s completion date.
If the application is made after completion of the installation, the application for payment must be submitted no later than three months from the date of the decision.
The charging station must be installed at a residence or place of work. The principal users must be the occupants of the residence or employees at the place of work. The charging stations may be used by visitors and others to a certain extent.
Grants may only be made for charging points installed on a property owned or lawfully occupied by the applicant.
The installation must be performed by an electrical installation company or electrical installer as intended by the Swedish Electrical Safety Act, i.e. a trader who carries out electrical installation works in a professional capacity and where the installer is authorised to carry out such works.
The grant is paid as a lump sum. The maximum possible grant is 50 per cent of the eligible cost, however not more than SEK 15,000 per charging point.
Eligible cost refers to the material and labour costs required to install the charging point, such as the cost of charging posts or charging boxes, cable laying, installation works and mains connection.
Labour costs eligible for a grant apply only to those works carried out by a person approved for F-tax (sole trader tax).
The application for payment and the required appendices must be lodged with the Swedish EPA within three months of completion of the installation.
If the installation was already completed when the application was submitted, the application for payment and the required appendices must be lodged with the EPA no later than three months from the decision date.
The decision to approve the grant is valid for a maximum of one year. This means the costs must be verified within one year.

Tenant-owner associations
Why should you, as a tenant-owner associations, invest in an electric car charging system? And what should you think about?
As the number of EVs rises, so too does the need for charging points. And the best charging location is where you usually park. It’s why more and more tenant-owner associations are investing in charging points so that all of the association’s residents can have access to charging.
Here are a few other reasons why tenant-owner associations should install charging points for EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs.
More people are driving EVs and want to charge at home
More and more people are choosing EVs, and the best place to charge them is at home where they usually park. It’s safe, secure and convenient.
It’s easy to install
All you need to do is run a power cable and install the charging system. It’s a simple job performed by a certified electrical installer. It’s important to check with your power company whether there is sufficient output available in the property and/or the area.
The state will bear half of the cost
You can apply to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency for financial support with half of the investment cost. You can recoup the rest of the cost by raising the parking fee. A smart climate investment at no additional cost to the association.
More associations are installing charging points
Many associations have already installed charging points and many are planning to increase the number of points. It’s a good idea to contact an association that’s already installed charging points for help and advice. We promise, there’s a great deal of interest.
Raises the value of apartments
As many estate agents will confirm, there is greater interest among potential buyers for associations with charging points.
Think about the future
There are many advantages in being one step ahead. It can be a problem if an association is unable to provide charging facilities. There is a risk of fire when charging via a regular wall plug, and of ugly alterations to the ground and external walls when residents perform the work at their own expense.
Check the demand and possibilities right now
Review the association’s requirement and think long-term so that your solution can grow as the demand for charging increases. Check the property’s fusing. If you lack this information, the electrical mains owner can help you.
Who pays for the electricity?
Compared to a house, calculating electricity consumption in a tenant-owner association is a little more difficult. But there are various ways. Smart charging systems have software that keeps tabs on who is charging and their electricity consumption. Some charging systems can even take care of billing. Otherwise, it’s easy for the association to calculate each member’s consumption from the charging system and then invoice this. If the charging system cannot meter consumption, the association can add a standard charge for electricity to the garage rent, or members can sign their own agreement with their electricity provider.
What to do when you apply for a grant to purchase an EV charging system.
The ‘Ladda bilen’ (Charge your car) investment subsidy from the Swedish EPA is aimed at tenant-owner associations and jointly owned properties that wish to install charging points for their own personal use.
The application must always be made in two steps.
The application for a grant
Request for payment
Always begin with an application in which you provide the estimated cost for the measures and the property in which the charging devices will be installed.
The EPA’s decision states whether or not the grant for the measures is approved. In order to request payment, you must first receive approval. The grant remains in the system until you submit the ‘Request for payment’ form, however not for more than 12 months.
APPLY HERE
Jointly owned properties
When a jointly owned property forms a shared parking facility, the National Land Survey draws up a facility order. It describes such things as which buildings may use the parking facility, its size and details such as the ability to connect charging stations.
Facility orders control what jointly owned properties may do with their installations. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to draw any general conclusions as to whether the charging points are included among permitted measures. Every jointly owned property’s facility order must be interpreted individually.
If you’re uncertain what the existing facility order includes, you can request a property definition order from the National Land Survey. This means the National Land Survey will make a legally binding interpretation if the desired changes are within the scope of the jointly owned property’s existing facility order.
The jointly owned property may make its own decision regarding EV charging
An association can resolve to install EV charging at its general meeting. However, any decision should also be backed up with an assurance from the National Land Survey that the facility order includes EV charging. Without such an assurance, a member may subsequently dispute the decision and a court may annul it.
Review the facility order if necessary
If the jointly owned property’s facility order does not cover EV charging, the association may apply to the National Land Survey for a review. The chances of getting a review increase if everyone is in agreement about making the change and for charging stations to be included in the facility.
At home
What are the advantages of installing an EV charging system at home?
Over the past 12 months, the number of EVs has increased by more than 140 per cent in Sweden. Many people still believe that installing your own charger is complicated and expensive. But a great deal has happened technologically in recent years, making it both easier and cheaper to charge EVs at home.
Smarter, safer and faster. And convenient.
Having a fixed installation at home is convenient.
Because the charger senses output via the main circuit breaker, your house will be smarter and so will your total electrical situation. It means you will no longer have to increase your circuit breaker size and raise your basic electricity charge just because you own a chargeable vehicle. The charger simply balances the load for the entire household.
Connected chargers make smart functions possible.
When you purchase a connected charger you can be sure your installation is future-proofed. And the socket, the physical Type 2 connector, is of the European standard that will be mandatory in the future. As a supplier, we will also continue developing services in addition to those available in the cloud. In the future, this will allow you to control your charging based on the electricity price.
Save time and make everyday life more efficient.
Fully charging an EV can take 10–11 hours using a regular electrical socket. In principle, this means you must charge your car from the moment you get home until it’s time to leave for work the following morning. This leaves no room for running other errands. A conventional electrical socket is not able to fully provide the right electrical capacity. There is a risk that your battery will be empty when it’s time to leave for work. Or you can install a charging system and get a good night’s sleep before driving to work the next day with a fully charged battery. Why take the risk?
The economic aspect
Driving an EV is kinder on the wallet than a fossil-fuelled car. But if you don’t have your own charging system it’s easy to end up in a downward spiral. When you charge your car at charging stations that lack efficient charging, where the system is poorly optimised and charging costs quickly get out of hand, you soon lose control of your charging costs.
What should you consider when investing in an EV charging system at home?
The National Electrical Safety Board advises against regular charging through conventional wall sockets and engine heater sockets.
Because old or defective connections and cable outlets in a property can overheat under load, which in turn may lead to fire, you should let an electrical installation company check your electrical installation.
Conventional wall sockets and engine heater sockets (Schuko) are not designed for EV charging and cannot cope with recurrent high loads over time; therefore always limit charging to 8-10A and hang the control box from a hook.
Extension leads must not be used as there is a risk that the fuse will not offer proper protection. Also, if the control box or extension lead ends up on the ground, they can easily be damaged. Never use equipment between the socket and the charger cable.
Connectors and safety
Different rechargeable vehicles uses different connectors, so it’s obviously important that the charging station connector is the right one for your car. But in principle, the following applies: Type 1 and Type 2 connectors are for normal charging, while CCS and CHAdeMO connectors are used for fast charging. The EU has stipulated that Type 2 and CCS connectors will be the standards. Make sure the charging station meets the Mode 3 safety level, also an EU standard.
Can I charge using the engine heater circuit or electrical socket?
Yes, but it’s not recommended as there are safety risks. But if you have access to an engine heater socket in your house or through the landlord you’re well on your way to safely charging your EV. In fact, it’s relatively easy to remove the engine heater post and replace it with a charging station instead.
How to apply for a grant when purchasing an EV charging system.
Economic support is available through the government environmental initiative when you install an EV charging system. Private individuals who own or lawfully occupy a property may apply for a grant for an EV charging station.
The charging station must be installed in a property the applicant owns or lawfully occupies. If you live in a property you do not own, you must append verification from the property owner that you have permission to install a charging station on the property. This could e.g. be a certificate from the board of the tenant-owner association.
The grant covers half of the cost of materials including the charging station and the labour costs for installing it. The maximum grant per property is SEK 10,000. According to the Swedish EPA, the term ‘property’ refers to the designation in the Land Register.
Example: If you live in an apartment block, you share the property designation with your neighbours. The Swedish EPA may only pay out SEK 10,000 per property.
Remember to save all your receipts. You will need them when you submit your application for a grant.

New, as of 2021 – The green deduction
As of the new year it will be cheaper to buy and install a charging box at home. The green deduction works in precisely the same way as the RUT and ROT deduction for certain repair works and conversions etc. This means you no longer need to apply for a grant from the Swedish EPA retroactively as the deduction is already made when you receive your invoice.

What our customers say
We love to talk about our smart solutions, but our customers can probably do it better.
Golf club & hotel
”For us, it made sense not to set up charging boxes but to go for a centralised charging system from ChargeNode instead. The beautiful natural surroundings that frame our golf, conference and hotel resort are unique and I’m more than happy for us to do our bit in the green transition. ChargeNode was the natural choice as we were looking for something that was sustainable, durable and which blended well into our surroundings.”
Sandra Taranger Eberstein
CEO
Öijared Resort
Hotel
”ESS Group and Ellery Beach House chose ChargeNode because the company understood us, our guests and our challenges right away. The system was impressive from day one and in our experience, they demonstrated a fundamentally genuine interest in the environment and in us as a company. A great combination that bodes well for a long-term partnership.”
Carl Lundgren

Petra Carnbäck
CEO
GOP – Glasfiber & Plastprodukter AB
Tenant-owner association
“ChargeNode was the obvious choice of charging system for our housing association. We have limited with available power and wanted to future-proof and equip all 36 places with access to charging in our garage. Many thanks to ChargeNode, Varberg Energi and Bravida!”

Guide to our app
Get moving with our app
Here’s a step-by-step guide showing how to download our app and register you and your vehicle to begin charging.
If you’re already registered and would like help with changing your details, click the link below.
Go to the guide to change your details
10 easy steps so
are you up and running
1
Begin by downloading the app.
Android
Iphone
2
Click ‘Create account’.
Enter your email and mobile telephone number (if you have a foreign number use e.g. +45…).
Then click ‘Create account’.
3
We’ll send a code to you via SMS. Enter the code and press the green button.
Sometimes it can take a few moments before the SMS arrives. If it does not arrive within a few minutes, press ‘Send SMS again’.
In the event of the wrong phone number, press ‘Send code via email instead’. We will then send an email with a link to automatically log you in.
4
Because your vehicle must be registered in order to charge it, we go immediately to ‘Add your car’ for a new account.
Enter the car’s registration number and if you want, give it a nickname. Foreign registration numbers also work.
5
Select the make of vehicle.
If you don’t know the make, or if the make is missing from the database, select ‘Other’ from the list.
Then you must specify if your vehicle is a BEV (battery only) or a hybrid (battery and a diesel/petrol engine).
6
If you do know the make and model of your vehicle (and we have it in our database), highlight it and click on ‘Select’.
7
Select the vehicle you want to charge.
8
Determine your position.
An area code is specified on the ChargeNode information sign next to the parking bay, and the socket to which you connect your cable is labelled with the bay number.
Press the QR code button and scan the QR code on the socket.
Select your departure time (the length of time you will be parked) from now to max 24 hours.
Specify the current battery charge (how full your battery is when we begin) by pulling the left handle. Specify the desired departure battery charge by pulling the right handle.
Press ‘Start’. The first time you charge in a location that requires payment, you must enter a payment card.
9
The first time you charge in a location that requires payment, you must enter your card details.
No money is debited to the card on this occasion; we collect info on each battery charge and deduct the total amount from your card at the end of the month.
Important information!
The vehicle’s on-board app
If your vehicle has its own app (e.g. Tesla) you will keep getting push notices saying that charging has been stopped, even though the desired charge has not been reached.
You can disregard this information. If you would like battery charge status updates, they are available in the ChargeNode app.
Already registered?
How to change your information
Select ‘Account’ from the menu.
Enter your information. Provide your telephone number using the international format (+46…).
Select how you would like to be notified: SMS or text to your telephone.

Privacy Notice
1. Introduction – what is personal data?
Personal data is all types of information that is directly or indirectly attributable to a living natural person. Charge Node Europé AB is the personal data controller for the data you provide via www.chargenode.eu or which is collected by us from other sources. Charge Node Europé AB always processes personal data with great respect for personal privacy. Below is a description of your rights, the guidelines that Charge Node Europé AB applies and how we process and store personal data. The guidelines never restrict your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or any other legally binding provisions. Contact details for the personal data controller and data protection officer can be found under item 12. Contacts
2. Collection of personal data
Unless otherwise specified, the information on this page applies to Charge Node Europé AB and to the website www.chargenode.eu. For further information on personal data processing, etc. within other companies owned by Charge Node Europé AB, please refer to the respective companies and their websites, if any.
3. ChargeNode websites
Normally, www.chargenode.eu can be visited without personal data being collected. We will only collect information used for statistical purposes, and the visitor will remain anonymous. Examples of such information are the time of the visit, the duration of the visit and the pages visited. Charge Node Europé AB also uses cookies to make sure the functions and services on the website work correctly.

You can read more about cookies at www.chargenode.eu/cookies

When a customer visits Charge Node Europé AB’s log-in services, the visit may be linked to the logged-in person’s customer number. This allows Charge Node Europé AB to provide more relevant and personalised communications to individual customers.
4. Personal data categories
The personal data categories we usually collect are:

Customer information – i.e. the information necessary for you to become a customer with us. Examples include your name, address, email address, telephone number, national insurance number, company registration number, bank details, vehicle registration number and GPS position.

Purchase information – i.e. products and services purchased, credit rating, payment history, customer number and password.

Technical information – electricity and network provider, installation identifier and type of connection.

Service information – i.e. correspondence on specific issues, purchase details, and any complaints or claims. Answers to customer surveys and feedback about our goods and services. Where appropriate, information provided in connection with competitions or other customer loyalty programs.

Demographic information (from public records) – i.e. age, gender, dwelling floor space, household make-up, etc. Visit information at log-in services – i.e. purchase and user-generated data, passwords, technical data regarding the device used, interaction data (visit time, response times, how to reach and leave the service, and more). Specific categories of personal data (defined in Article 9 (1) of the GDPR) are only processed in exceptional cases. We need your consent to process personal data in such cases. There are also occasions when we are legally obliged to collect and process sensitive personal data of this kind.
5. Information when data is collected
When personal data is provided to us, the person providing his or her personal data will be informed about which Charge Node Europé AB company is responsible for processing the personal data, for what purpose and on what legal basis the personal data is collected; the contact details of the data controller and data protection officer and the customer’s rights for as long as the data is stored. If you feel the information is unclear or incomplete, please contact Charge Node Europé AB for complete information.
6. Purpose and legal basis for processing
We only collect personal data for purposes supported by the applicable data protection regulations. Usually, the data is collected for processing under the legal basis for the performance of contracts. For example, the purpose may be for marketing and profiling, i.e. to communicate relevant offers to our customers

for the sale of our offers and those of our partners,
for sending newsletters,
for developing and improving our products and services,
and for statistics and analyses.
Other purposes for processing personal data may be based on various legal requirements, i.e. where we have to fulfil a legal obligation; examples of such purposes are the processing of personal data under the Swedish Accounting Act for invoicing or when we communicate information about amended contractual terms. In some cases, you may also give consent to processing where none of the above applies. Any consent given is a deliberate action on your part and may be withdrawn. We will then no longer process your personal data for that purpose.
7. Transfer of personal data
Because Charge Node Europé AB has subsidiaries with Group-wide functions, your personal data may be disclosed to other companies within the Group. Such companies may also process your data for the purpose of providing offers and marketing products and services that may be of interest to you.

Under certain circumstances, we may also provide personal data to personal data processors, partners or other third parties.

In the event of a transfer, Charge Node Europé AB takes account of the special laws and other provisions governing the separation between electricity trading companies and electricity network companies (known as unbundling regulations). In certain cases upon a request under law or by government directive, we may be obliged to disclose personal data to e.g. the police for crime prevention measures and criminal investigations.

As a rule, personal data is not disclosed to companies in countries outside the EU or EEA. However, in certain circumstances the data may be transferred to, and processed in, non-EU/EEA countries by a Charge Node Europé AB Group company or by another supplier or subcontractor. In such cases, a special study is always carried out to make sure safeguards such as data transfer agreements are in place so that the recipients process the data at a level comparable to the protection offered in the EU/EEA.
8. Access to personal data
Only those who need access to the personal data in order to perform the agreed service are authorised to access and process it. We have a number of subcontractors who process personal data to varying extents and they have the same requirements for processing as Charge Node Europé AB has internally.
9 Purging
We do not save personal data any longer than necessary. Once your agreement has expired and you are no longer our customer, we will retain your data for 36 months. The same applies to contact information for our corporate customers. However, it may be necessary to retain some data for longer in order to meet other legal requirements, such as the Accounting Act, under which we must save data for 7 years. There is also reason to keep this information for longer in the event of an investigation or dispute, even if the customer relationship was previously terminated, or if you have purchased a product from us where we need to save the information in order to fulfil our warranty obligations.
10. Security
We take special physical, technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data processed so that it is not lost, destroyed, manipulated or made available to unauthorised persons. The measures are aimed at providing a level of security that is sufficiently high with regard to the technical capabilities that exist. Any changes in the personal data are continuously recorded to ensure traceability of all amendments to the data. Personal data incidents are reported internally and by our subcontractors. These are managed in an internal process and, where relevant, notified (if there is a high level of risk to the individual’s rights and freedoms) to the Swedish Data Inspection Board within 72 hours, and under the provisions of the Data Protection Act, to the person who has lost his or her data. Also, data intrusion is reported to the police.
11. Your rights
a. Right of access
Everyone has the right to receive information about the extent to which their personal data is processed by Charge Node Europé AB. If Charge Node Europé AB is in possession of such personal data, the person affected will receive on request information about the categories of personal data processed, the source of the data collected, the purpose(s) for which processing takes place, the legal basis and to whom the data is disclosed. Anyone requesting such information must be able to confirm their identity. Charge Node Europé AB will respond to the electoral roll address registered with Charge Node Europé AB within 1 month of receiving the request.
b. Right to rectification
Everyone has the right to request rectification of their own customer data if it is incorrect or processed in breach of applicable law.
c. Right to erasure
Charge Node Europé AB erases personal data when there is no legal basis for retaining it. Our customers have the right to have their personal data erased immediately if any of the following apply:
Processing is based solely on your consent and you revoke it.
The data is no longer needed for the purposes for which it has been processed.
Processing takes place for direct marketing purposes and you are opposed to the processing of your data for that purpose.
The data has not been processed according to GDPR.
You oppose processing that takes place following consideration of the balance of interests, and the legitimate reasons do not outweigh your interests.
Erasure is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation.
d. Right to oppose automated decision-making
Charge Node Europé AB does not apply automated decision-making in any field in respect of the registered person.
e. Right to restriction of processing
In certain cases you have the right to demand that the processing of your personal data be restricted. This applies if you e.g. believe that your personal data is incorrect and you have requested a rectification. During the investigation, you may request that the processing of your personal data be restricted.
f. Right to compensation
You may have the right to compensation in certain cases e.g. if our processing of your personal data has caused you harm. Claims may be made directly to Charge Node Europé AB.
g. Links
Unless otherwise specified, the information on this page applies to Charge Node Europé AB and for www.chargenode.eu. For further information on personal data processing, etc. in other Charge Node Europé AB subsidiaries, please refer to the respective companies and their websites, if any. In cases where this website contains links to other websites inside or outside the Charge Node Group, this information generally does not apply to such websites. Moreover, Charge Node Europé AB is not responsible for the content of such websites.
h. Changes to the personal data policy
If any changes are made to Charge Node Europé AB’s personal data policy, they will be announced on this page. For example, the policy may change if legislation or its application changes.

All in one. Charging, lighting and elegant parking.
Just how elegant are plastic charging boxes at every parking bay?
Not very elegant at all. So we took our patent-pending charging technology and teamed up with
Westal
, one of Sweden?s most illustrious companies when it comes to luminaires. Together we created stylish lighting bollards with integrated charging sockets that create electrifying surroundings in more ways than one.
Super-smart and elegant, or what?

Confidentiality& security
General terms and conditions
Charge Node Europé AB’s (”ChargeNode”) General Terms and Conditions for users regarding the ChargeNode battery charging service.
Valid from 1/1/2020.
§1 The ChargeNode battery charging service (”the Service”)
ChargeNode provides battery charging services at charging stations owned by third parties and which are public and non-public. All charging stations are considered to be connected to ChargeNode’s charging station network.
The provisions of these terms and conditions address the Service and the use of the ChargeNode app (i.e. the purchase and payment for battery charging) and apply to battery charging at the ChargeNode charging station network. Charging stations that are part of the ChargeNode network are clearly marked with the ChargeNode logo.
§2 ChargeNode App
To access the Service and use the ChargeNode charging stations, the user must first download the ChargeNode App and register with it. The app can be downloaded from www.chargenode.eu/ladda
ChargeNode may carry out a routine credit check of the User.
The app only applies to charging stations that are part of the ChargeNode network. The network includes public and non-public charging stations. Every instance of the app confers the right to charge batteries at public charging stations, but may be restricted in non-public locations depending on the charging station owner’s setup.
The cost of each battery charge is registered under the holder of the app. In other words, use of the Service at any time is deemed to be an acknowledgement of battery charging and the conclusion of an agreement for the purchase of battery charging between the User and ChargeNode, or the charging station owner connected to ChargeNode.
The User agrees to keep his or her user name and password confidential to prevent unauthorized access. If transactions are made through the unauthorized use of the User’s personal data, the User must notify the police.
§3 Equipment and the use of ChargeNode charging stations
As necessary, the User must provide a Mode 3 Type 2 cable for AC charging at stations with Mode 3 Type 2 sockets.
Charging station owners in the ChargeNode network must make sure the charging stations comply with applicable standards, laws and regulations.
Charging capacity depends on multiple factors, such as the technical characteristics of the electric vehicle, the level of charge in the vehicle battery and charging station capacity. The component with the lowest capacity will determine the output the electric vehicle can accept. ChargeNode cannot guarantee that charging an electric vehicle will be possible within any maximum specified time limit or at a minimum output. Furthermore, battery charging ordered through the ChargeNode app places users in a charging queue, based on the charge required and departure time. Because loads vary at any given time, the User cannot be guaranteed a certain charge. However, the User will only pay for the charge received.
Instructions on how to use ChargeNode charging stations are provided at or in the vicinity of the charging stations.
§4 Availability
The Service is available to the User 24 hours a day, but in practice the ability to charge may be limited, for example, by the fact that some charging stations are not accessible at certain times due to special restrictions.
ChargeNode endeavours to keep charging stations in the ChargeNode network operational to the greatest extent possible. Should a charging station suffer a technical fault, ChargeNode will try to correct the fault as quickly as possible.
ChargeNode reserves the right, without compensation to the User, to change, limit access to, or suspend the Service or charging station for such things as updates, maintenance and repair or as a result of force majeure.
§5 Payment
Use of the Service in the form of charging history is filed under the registered User account. The cost to the User is calculated based on the battery charging history.
Payment in arrears for completed charges take place on the 28th of every month. The user undertakes to make sure sufficient funds are available on the credit or debit card when payment is due. ChargeNode has the right to continue charging the fees and to make further attempts to complete the payment until the fee is settled.
The User is liable to ChargeNode for all use of the Service conducted under the User’s account.
The user is responsible for providing updated payment card details. See §12 for use of the ChargeNode mobile application.
Under the Swedish Interest Act (1975:635), if payment is not made on time, ChargeNode will have the right to claim interest on the invoice amount from the due date specified in the invoice, and also for compensation for the costs associated with the delay. It also includes costs for written past-due reminders and costs for the enforcement of payment or other obligations.
ChargeNode also has the right to suspend a User’s account if payment conditions are not met.(Refer also to §9 Validity.)
§6 Payment obligation for the Service.
Once the user has registered his or her payment method, ChargeNode has the right to debit the User for the Service described under §5. The User does not have the right to a refund for the use of the Service.
§7 Consumption data and personal data
ChargeNode will retain the charging history for each User (which includes such things as information about the charging station used, electrical power consumed, the time the Service was used and the amount.) The charging history forms the basis for invoicing Users.
Personal information and data relating to the User’s use of the Service and its charging stations will be processed and stored by ChargeNode and other Group companies or ChargeNode partners in accordance with applicable law and to the extent necessary for the administration and fulfilment of the user agreement and associated services.
Data collected will also be processed in connection with business and product development, statistics, market and user analyses and direct marketing (provided that the User has not notified ChargeNode that he or she is opposed to direct marketing). Such processing is based on ChargeNode’s legitimate interests. Information collected will be retained while the User has an active agreement with us and then for the time necessary for the User to settle his or her contractual relationship with ChargeNode.
As a rule, personal data is not disclosed to companies in countries outside the EU or EEA. Should this nevertheless occur, ChargeNode will make sure all legal conditions are met.
Users can receive information free of charge once a year about the processing of personal data relating to them. Users may also request that personal data that has not been processed in accordance with applicable law be rectified, blocked or erased. Further information about personal data at ChargeNode is available at www.chargenode.eu/privacypolicy.
§8 Liability for errors etc.
ChargeNode accepts no liability for any damage caused by incompatibility between the User’s vehicle and the charging station, or use of the Service or charging station in contravention of the instructions and technical requirements in force at any given time and as described in this Agreement or otherwise made available to the User by ChargeNode.
ChargeNode accepts no liability for any indirect or consequential damages relating to damage to the User’s property arising out of the use of the Service or the charging station by the User.
The User does not have the right to damages due to the closure or malfunction of a charging station.
The User must comply with all policies and requirements in accordance with the instructions issued by ChargeNode from time to time. This includes making sure that the electric vehicle used by the User in conjunction with the Service meets all charging requirements.
The User must also make sure that his or her user account cannot be used or misused by unauthorized persons.
ChargeNode reserves the right to immediately block the User’s account if there is a risk of unsafe use, suspicion of unauthorized use or a risk that the User will fail to fulfil his or her obligations to ChargeNode.
§9 Agreement transfer
The User acknowledges that ChargeNode may, subject to the same terms and conditions, transfer in whole or in part its rights and obligations under this Agreement to another company within the same Group or to another party which may reasonably be expected to fulfil the obligations under this Agreement in a satisfactory manner.
The User does not have the right to transfer or grant to others, in whole or in part, the use of his or her rights or obligations under the Agreement.
§10 Validity
These terms and conditions apply to the agreement until further notice. ChargeNode has the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect if the User violates these terms and conditions or uses the Service or a charging station in such a way as to cause nuisance or damage to ChargeNode.
§11 Amending terms and conditions
ChargeNode has the right to amend these terms and conditions provided that the User is notified of the amendment via the App or by email at least 14 days prior to its taking effect. In such cases, the User will be deemed notified two days after the email is sent or the update is made known in the app.
§12 Disputes
Disputes relating to the application or interpretation of the Agreement or related issues is matter for settlement in the first instance by negotiation and agreement between the Parties. Disputes may also be settled in general court, in which case Swedish law will apply. Disputes may also be reviewed by the National Board for Consumer Disputes.
§13 Use of the ChargeNode mobile application
ChargeNode offers a mobile application that enables users to find stations and pay for charging at ChargeNode charging stations. ChargeNode reserves the right to close the ChargeNode mobile application at any time, without compensation to the User. The User does not have the right to damages because the ChargeNode mobile app is out of service.
§A Function and use of the ChargeNode payment solution
Battery charging with ChargeNode: The User may start and stop charging by using the matching smartphone application – prior registration is required as described under §3.
Battery charging fees: Battery charging fees follow the relevant business partner’s cost structure. The User can find information about this from the partner company through which the battery charging fees were debited, and their various levels, on the relevant partner’s internet platform.
§B Payment card registration

Our innovation
Super-smart charging for more EVs
Our patent-pending charge technology in a nutshell
1. Because multiple vehicles share a single centralised charging cabinet, you only need to place a charging socket at each parking bay. Combine them with our elegant aluminium power bar or stylish
lighting bollards
. Stylish and smart.
2. Our super-smart software optimises and distributes available output based on the number of connected EVs, departure times, vehicle charging capacity and the desired charge. Everyone gets charged without your having to raise the property’s power rating.
3. Our charging technology offers 16-63A circuit breakers or load-balancing with the property and can deliver up to 22 kW per charging socket.
4. All electrical components are well protected in a sturdy charging cabinet that can be installed indoors or out. Safe, sustainable and reliable.
5. Users control and pay for charging via our simple app. The property owner monitors, bills and gets reports via our cloud service.
Let’s tell you more
Fully charged with super-smart control
It’s easy to download the app and activate charging. Any payment is also made in the app.
Use our smart cloud services to set prices and manage access, operation and billing.
Our advantages
Scalable
A single ChargeNode cabinet can supply up to 54 charging sockets. Which means the same number of EVs can be parked and recharged. Our charging technology is future-proof and easy to scale up to handle hundreds of charging sockets.
Super-smart
Our dynamic charging technology and smart algorithms calculate the charging order and output to each EV. In this way, available output is concentrated or distributed to connected EVs based on a number of parameters. An EV parked for a short while can receive maximum output, while one parked for longer can make do with lower.
Cost effective
Because multiple EVs share a single central charging cabinet, the volume of expensive, sensitive electrical components is reduced, which is great for your budget and the environment.
Eco-friendly
Fewer components = lower environmental impact. What’s more, the estimated 20-year service life means it will be a long, long while before your charging system needs replacing.
Sustainable
The forces of nature are seldom kind to electrical components. Moisture, heat, cold and wind all have an effect on reliability and service life. ChargeNode technology concentrates all sensitive electrical components in a sturdy cabinet with the absolute highest IP rating. The cabinet can be located in a sheltered spot indoors or outdoors.
Aesthetic
No matter how good a charging box design may be, it’s still just a box, usually plastic, mounted on a post or a wall. But ChargeNode technology makes all the boxes disappear completely. Instead, only the charging sockets are installed at each parking bay, and these can be fully integrated into your surroundings e.g. in
luminaires
,
handrails
or façades. The design possibilities are endless.
See customer installations
Guaranteed, end-to-end solution
We take overall responsibility for hardware, software, installation, operation, billing and support. No unexpected costs.
3-year warranty. Estimated service life of at least 20 years.
Customer reference
”For us, it made sense not to set up charging boxes but to go for a centralised charging system from ChargeNode instead. The beautiful natural surroundings that frame our golf, conference and hotel resort are unique and I’m more than happy for us to do our bit in the green transition. ChargeNode was the natural choice as we were looking for something that was sustainable, durable and which blended well into our surroundings.”

Our story
A greentech company for the future
We are an experienced team of specialists and entrepreneurs in the fields of software and electronics with a passion for hurrying along the transition to a fossil-free society.
We’re convinced that our super-smart charging technology is the answer to the large-scale EV charging the world has been looking for and we’re all charged up and determined to make it so.
Every day we give our all to make the world a cleaner, better place while trying to maintain our start-up approach with speedy decision paths, rock ‘n’ roll and a belief that nothing is impossible.
Meet the team
Scalable, sustainable technology. Now that’s smart.
Our patent-pending charging technology is as simple as it’s ingenious.
Multiple vehicles share a central charging unit. Only a charging socket is located at each parking bay.
The expensive, sensitive electrical components are protected in a sturdy charging cabinet. This equates to reliable operation and great durability.
We have developed our own software and optimisation algorithm that makes sure all connected EVs get the right charge.
Our innovative charging technology makes much better use of available charging capacity. This eliminates the need to install expensive charging boxes in every parking bay.

Our history
How a long wait was the genesis of charging without waiting.
In 2014
, serial entrepreneur and electrical engineer Kristian Sandahl bought his first rechargeable EV.
In 2015
, Kristian’s curiosity about reducing his charging costs at home led him to apply for a patent on an electricity sub-meter that could reduce the total cost of power in a property by up to 25%.
When he later had to queue to charge his EV in a major public car park that only had three charging boxes, all of which were occupied, he realised that there must be a smarter way to charge multiple vehicles without installing expensive charging boxes in every parking bay. With his excellent knowledge of charging times, Kristian also realised that most EVs were parked for much longer than it took to charge them fully. From these two insights, the idea was conceived to let multiple parking bays share charging capacity.
In 2016
, Kristian, together with electrician and entrepreneur Henrik Nilsson, began the patent registration process for his revolutionary charging technology.
Charge Node Europé AB was registered
in 2018
.
The first prototype ChargeNode charging system was installed
in 2019
at Varberg Energi, and IT entrepreneur Niklas Berg joined them to prepare commercialisation.
ChargeNode launched its charger technology
in 2020
, and in less than one year we have installed more than 1500 charging sockets with property owners, tenant-owner associations, hotels and golf clubs all over Sweden
2021
Formica Capital AB invests SEK 115 million in ChargeNode to accelerate Swedish and international expansion. Formica is a Swedish investment company with a long-term ownership strategy, owned by the Olsson Eriksson family, part of the Stena family. Formica Capital creates value growth by being an active owner of companies that drive the transition to a sustainable society.

We simply call it
The Power Bar
An elegant, climate-smart aluminium trunking with charging sockets for everyone.
EV charging with multiple sockets
This is more or less how we’d describe our trailblazing charging technology. More specifically, our patent-pending charging technology means many vehicles share a single centralised charging unit that distributes power based on parking time and charging needs.
Only the charging sockets are located at each parking bay, and in this way you avoid installing expensive charging boxes at every bay.
Learn more
Upright or horizontal?
Our smart power bar solution can be installed on a wall, as bollards or handrails on ground screws. Hidden in the bushes or underground, our power bar is at home anywhere.
And because all the cabling is hidden away in ducting, you also avoid expensive ground works.
We very recently installed 30 outlets in Opalparken just outside Gothenburg in a top-quality, modern multi-story car park that demanded modern EV charging.
See more installations
Climate-smart in more ways than one
Driving an EV is climate-smart, but our proprietary power bar solution manufactured from green, recycled aluminium makes it even smarter. What’s more, our solution has a service life of at least 20 years.
Learn more
Easy-to-use app & cloud service
Users can easily download our app to activate and control charging.
Our cloud service makes it easy for associations to provide access, monitor operations, see electricity consumption per user and bill users.
And if you allow guests to charge their EVs, our app makes it easy for them to activate and pay for charging. You get to choose whether to add a surcharge for the electricity.

Because charging is so flexible, you become more competitive with places that do not provide charging. It’s the kind of thing that also strengthens your brand.

A win-win-win set up for you, your guests and our planet.

Charging means new revenues
Why you should offer charging:
1. New revenue
Offer charging and bill users in the same way as for parking. You choose the electricity surcharge, we take care of operations and customer payments.
2. More visitors
When you offer charging, EV owners will choose you over places that lack charging.
3. Strengthen your brand. And save the environment.
By offering EV charging, you’re making a conscious, eco-friendly choice to help the transition to a fossil-free society.

Thanks to our extensive experience in installing flexible, scalable charging systems, we can help you make the right choice. Our solution lets everyone in the association charge their cars without raising the property’s power rating. We raise the value of the property instead.

I’d really like your help!
Fully charged with super-smart control
All you need to do to activate and control charging is download our app.
Our cloud service makes it easy for associations to provide access, monitor operations, see electricity consumption per user and bill them.
Your guests can also charge their cars. They use our app to activate and pay for charging. You decide if you want to add a surcharge to the electricity price.

Why you should choose us
Innovative and optimised
EVs rarely need to charge more than 2–3 hours. But in tenant-owner associations, they’re often parked for a long while, especially at night. Installing a charging box in every parking bay and maybe having to invest in a larger power supply cable from the mains is not particularly cost-effective.

Our innovative charging technology distributes available output from a central charging cabinet to the connected vehicles. Because charging is optimised for each EV’s parking time, charge requirement and battery capacity, up to 54 vehicles can share a single charging cabinet, and each vehicle can charge at up to 22 kW. What’s more, the system can be scaled up to hundreds of charging points.
Stylish and eco-friendly
Our solution only requires one charging socket for each parking bay. This allows the outlets to be neatly and discreetly integrated into your parking environment.
Durable and reliable
All sensitive electronics are separated from the charging sockets and brought together in a central charging cabinet with the highest IP Rating. The charging cabinets are manufactured in Sweden using standard components of very high quality. This makes for a reliable charging environment and a service life of more than 20 years. And for the sake of your peace of mind, all of our installations come with a 3-year warranty.

What do our customers have to say?
“ChargeNode’s centralized charging system provides efficient economies of scale, increased flexibility and is easy to expand as needs increase. Because the software optimizes charging per car based on, among other things, departure time and the number of connected cars, we were able to install 72 seats without having to upgrade other electrical infrastructure or electricity subscriptions.”

Worthwhile questions
Can our electrical system handle charging?
Yes. Because our charging system’s output is optimised through load-balancing (3.0), it can be installed in all properties. This means our charging system will never overload the electrical system.
How do we install a ChargeNode charging system?
Our sturdy charging cabinets can be installed in many ways, both indoors and out. Many customers choose to install trunking, i.e. a hollow rail available in many colours that runs in front of the parking bays. This requires no ground works. The outlets can also be installed in lighting bollards or directly on walls / façades. Smart and stylish.
What else will your charging system need?
It will need hard-wire access to the internet and a 16 A or greater supply cable, depending on the rate of use.
Why should I choose the charging system from ChargeNode?
Well, how about a scalable charging solution with a long service life and depreciation time? A smaller power supply cable compared to conventional charging box solutions. And a super-smart charging system where sensitive electrical components are gathered together and protected in a sturdy charging cabinet. In an installation free from groundwork. And last but not least, minimal maintenance.
How do we (tenant-owner associations, companies, car parks etc.) bill our customers?
We can take care of all user billing. Users register their payment cards in our app and are then debited monthly or on each occasion they charge their vehicle. Easy peasy.

Choose between billing based on user consumption (number of kWh) and/or on a fixed price (standard) per month. If you prefer to look after billing yourself, invoice templates are available from our cloud service.
Sounds pretty smart, eh?
We’d love to tell you more.

<p>As the number of EV owners rose, a jointly owned property association (Stora Sjöfallets Samfällighetsförening) in Norra Djurgården, Stockholm, realized it was high time to install more charging sockets. Following a thorough market survey, they chose ChargeNode. Largely because it was a simple, flexible and cost-effective solution.</p>

				<p>When the property association decided to invest seriously in a modern EV charging solution, there were not all that many association members charging cars. But pretty soon after the 15 old charging boxes had been taken down and replaced with ChargeNode’s solution, EV usage grew significantly. Today, almost 30 spaces are used every month. This constitutes a very healthy 25%.</p>

				<p>There were a number of criteria that were distinctly to ChargeNode’s advantage. Costs were naturally one; there were no fixed fees, and the long service life kept total ownership costs low. Simplicity was equally as important. There was a minimum of admin for the association, and it was also easy to process payments. It’s also easy for people charging their cars – the app is as clear as crystal and there’s no need to worry about finding a special charging point. Other advantages include distance monitoring, remote control and dynamic, smart load-balancing. What’s more, the installation is stylish and attractive.</p>
<p>The garage is shared with Wallenstam, which has the most places, and three tenant-owner associations, all of which removed old charging boxes of various makes to install a total of 117 charging sockets from ChargeNode – one per parking space. Installing this number of charging points on a single occasion has given the parking garage a distinct green profile.</p>

				<p>ESS Group, which has already established 10 different high-class concepts, is raising the bar with Jacy’z Hotel &amp; Resort, a destination for food, relaxation, meetings, fitness and living. And everything comes with an exclusive feel right down to the smallest detail.</p>
<p>Part of this generous package includes offering its guests ChargeNode’s efficient, super-simple EV charging. The installation consists of stylish black beams with a total of 45 charging points split between two levels in the hotel’s parking garage. They are aesthetically pleasing and blend in nicely with the hotel’s internationally savvy design.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re very pleased to enjoy the continued trust of ESS Group. It’s confirmation that we can offer attractive, reliable solutions at the highest level. We’ve already installed half of the planned 45 charging points, and the remainder are in progress,&#8221; says Kristian Sandahl, ChargeNode CEO.</p>

				<p>Blå Huset understood early on that there was a great need for EV charging, something that was also in line with the office block’s conscious environmental profile. It soon became an important issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re aware of the impact we have on the environment and climate,&#8221; says Blå Huset’s Mattias Feldt. &#8220;Which is why it’s so important for us to stay ahead of the game. Within five years, 80% of company vehicles will almost certainly be hybrid or EVs. It’s also why we chose to install 53 charging sockets with integrated outlets in our car park. By making EV charging available in as many parking bays as possible, we will enable customers to avoid moving their cars around during working hours.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;The work from contract to system commissioning with various design solutions for charging EVs went very smoothly,” continued Mattias. “Something our customers appreciate. Our customer portal gives us a good overview, and our employees and visitors find the app very easy to use. We’ve future-proofed things in a pretty smart way. Offering many charging points will be a must in the future. People will take EV charging at workplaces for granted. This means electricity companies will have to expand their networks, which is a challenge.&#8221;</p>

				-When I started in the industry, there were not many electric cars, but when the authorities set goals for electrification of the Norwegian private car fleet for 2025, my interest grew. I have had the pleasure of following and shaping this journey, but it has been commercially challenging to design good solutions at the same pace as the market, technology and standards have developed. To find the best solutions for the domestic market, I have worked with many European manufacturers of both AC and DC solutions. It was when doing some international due diligence that ChargeNode turned up with an exciting mindset on how to meet the need for charging based on an energy-efficient, scalable and sustainable model with a number of advantages: The ability to use available energy in a smart way to charge as many electric cars as possible, opportunity for many charging socket without everyone needing a charging box. Material and aesthetic expression that lasts longer than other solutions. Low operating and ownership costs which guarantee a scalable facility long term. As ChargeNode develops its own software and hardware, we can ensure industry leading functionality and operational stability for users. In addition, we have innovative founders combined an experienced team in Sweden who put their heart and soul into the development of the product and the company. When I got the chance to join, it felt completely natural to follow this exciting journey.					</div>

				<strong>What is the difference between the Swedish and Norwegian markets?</strong>
<br>
There are both similarities and major differences between the Norwegian and Swedish markets. The biggest difference is probably the total electric car market and the sale of new cars. The market is more mature in Norway and a natural choice when buying a new car. If you combine electric cars and rechargeable hybrids, 22% of all cars in Norway and only 6% in Sweden are chargeable. This means that we have to solve the need for charging, at home, at work and on the roads, and that is not an easy task. I think the need in the Swedish and Norwegian markets is similar, Norway is only a few years ahead  in EV charging roll out. . Among other things, thanks to a favorable incentive program related to the purchase of electric vehicles, the use of electric cars and the establishment of an infrastructure for charging has seen Norway taking the lead globally with Sweden a few years behind.
<br><br>
<strong>What challenges do you see in the industry?</strong>
<br>
The industry is still fairly new and we probably do not see all the challenges yet. Even though we will see great development of energy efficient batteries, there will still be a huge need to charge. To avoid bottlenecks, we must charge when we can, not when we have to. With more and more electric cars, there must be more charging sockets. I also see a major challenge in leveling out energy consumption over a longer period of the day, which will help optimize the existing infrastructure. To meet these challenges, manufacturers and suppliers must be innovative.
<br><br>
<strong>Norway has the most electric cars per capita in the world, have you noticed any challenges with that?</strong>
<br>
Norway has become a kind of test market for everyone who has a solution for electric car use. All innovations are unfortunately not well designed or sustainable long term. Although Norway has a high density of electric cars, Norway is a small market with several challenges to address. We do not know how well solutions developed across the globe works in Norway. We also see that we have challenges related to the electric car density in urban areas, where today&#8217;s technology is unable to meet the demand for electric car charging.
<br><br>
<strong>How big is the need for scalable EV charging in Norway?</strong>
<br>
Today, we have many 1st and 2nd generation solutions that no longer cover the need for todays EV charging and since our car fleet has an average age of over 10 years, the number of electric cars will continue to grow exponentially. I would argue that scalable electric car charging will be a key factor for the future if we want to continue grow at this pace and not overload the energy grid. The need is huge.
<br><br>
<strong>What are your expectations when ChargeNode is launched on the Norwegian market?</strong>
<br>
I look forward to inform the Norwegian market how ChargeNodes scalable charging technology can solve many challenges and enable more people to charge. I expect us to grow and become a significant player, just like in Sweden.
<br><br>
<strong>What is best about ChargeNodes charging technology?</strong>
<br>
The ChargeNode charging station, centrally located where all expensive and operational components are safely located, while type 2 sockets are installed at the parking lot. Other advantages are the simple app and charging portal that prioritizes the power in the system dynamically between 3 and 22kW to dedicated charging nodes prioritized according to departure needs and finally the simple payment methods combined with a solid service promise.
<br><br>
<strong>What will be the next step for the Norwegian market?</strong>
<br>
It is important that we can quickly establish ourselves in Norway and inform the Norwegian market about ChargeNodes innovative and unique charging technology. We need to establish offices with more resources in sales while also building collaborations and partnerships in the market. We want to be a player with an active presence for our customers and partners in Norway.					</div>

Three smart reasons to offer charging
1. More revenue, less work
Offer charging and bill users in the same way as for parking. You choose the electricity surcharge, we take care of operations and customer payments.
2. More satisfied visitors
More and more tenants need to charge their EVs at home and at work. Offering EV charging makes you an attractive landlord.
3. Strengthen your brand. And save the environment.
By offering EV charging, you’re making a conscious, eco-friendly choice to help the transition to a fossil-free society.
Request an offer
Our scalable charging system
With our patent-pending charging system you enjoy worry-free ownership, a 10-year depreciation period and the lowest total cost.
Centralised charging technology
A single sturdy charging cabinet can charge up to 54 cars. Each parking bay only needs one charging socket with an output of up to 22 kW. The system can be scaled up to hundreds of charging points.
Minimal groundwork
With our stylish power bar solution, you’ll avoid cable laying and expensive groundwork.
Lower power requirement
With smart optimisation and output sharing, 35-63A (3-phase) is ample in large buildings. Fuse protection and load-balancing with your building are of course included.
Smart control
Our smart cloud services let you monitor access, operation and invoicing. Visitors control charging and our easy-to-use app makes payment simple.
Guaranteed, end-to-end solution
Our end-to-end solution includes planning, installation, operation and payment solutions, always with a 3-year warranty. You can bank on a service life of at least 20 years.
Super-smart, worry-free!

WOW
Don’t miss out on your EV charger grant
The climate leap initiative will be reintroduced for visitor chargers in public spaces and there is a new subsidy for non-public charging. The subsidies cover up to 50% of the investment.
Get in touch and we’ll tell you more and help you through the application process.
I’d really like your help!
Fully charged with super-smart control
To activate charging, users simply download our app. Any billing take place via the app.
Use our smart cloud services to set prices and manage access, operation and billing.

Why you should choose us
Innovative and optimised
EVs rarely need to charge more than 2–3 hours. But in tenant-owner associations, they’re often parked for a long while, especially at night. Installing a charging box in every parking bay and maybe having to invest in a larger power supply cable from the mains is not particularly cost-effective.
Our innovative charging technology distributes available output from a central charging cabinet to the connected vehicles. Because charging is optimised for each EV’s parking time, charge requirement and battery capacity, up to 54 vehicles can share a single charging cabinet, and each vehicle can charge at up to 22 kW. What’s more, the system can be scaled up to hundreds of charging points.
Stylish and eco-friendly
Our solution only requires one charging socket for each parking bay. This allows the outlets to be neatly and discreetly integrated into your parking environment.
Because multiple vehicles share a single charging cabinet, investment costs, the amount of expensive materials and environmental impact are all reduced. The difference is enormous compared to conventional charging systems, where each parking bay requires its own charging box.

Durable and reliable
All sensitive electronics are separated from the charging sockets and brought together in a central charging cabinet with the highest IP Rating. The charging cabinets are manufactured in Sweden using standard components of very high quality. This makes for a reliable charging environment and a service life of more than 20 years. And for the sake of your peace of mind, all of our installations come with a 3-year warranty.

Customer reference
”ChargeNode was the obvious choice. The system is more efficient and flexible than any other solution we evaluated. We chose a power bar installation with charging sockets. What’s more, we can easily expand the system as the demand for charging points grows.”
Petra Carnbäck
CEO
GOP – Glasfiber & Plastprodukter AB

Worthwhile questions
Can our electrical system handle charging?
Yes. Because our charging system’s output is optimised through load-balancing (3.0), it can be installed in all properties. This means our charging system will never overload the electrical system.
How do we install a ChargeNode charging system?
Our sturdy charging cabinets can be installed in many ways, both indoors and out. Many customers choose to install trunking, i.e. a hollow rail available in many colours that runs in front of the parking bays. This requires no ground works. The outlets can also be installed in lighting bollards or directly on walls / façades. Smart and stylish.
What else will your charging system need?
It will need hard-wire access to the internet and a 16 A or greater supply cable, depending on the rate of use.
Why should I choose the charging system from ChargeNode?
Well, how about a scalable charging solution with a long service life and depreciation time? A smaller power supply cable compared to conventional charging box solutions. And a super-smart charging system where sensitive electrical components are gathered together and protected in a sturdy charging cabinet. In an installation free from groundwork. And last but not least, minimal maintenance.
How do we (tenant-owner associations, companies, car parks etc.) bill our customers?
We can take care of all user billing. Users register their payment cards in our app and are then debited monthly or on each occasion they charge their vehicle. Easy peasy.
Choose between billing based on user consumption (number of kWh) and/or on a fixed price (standard) per month. If you prefer to look after billing yourself, invoice templates are available from our cloud service.

Sustainability
The best of both worlds
We’re very fortunate to work at ChargeNode as we have the world’s best job and also get to work for a more sustainable future society. And we would also like to share what sustainability means for us!
A fair and decent workplace
We believe in a fair and decent workplace. People who are happy at work have more energy and enthusiasm to contribute to our business.
For us, this means fair conditions regardless of gender, ethnicity and background. It also means a company culture in which we take care of each other, show respect and have a healthy balance between work and our private lives.
Close, long-term relationships
We strive to make sure our products will have a service life of at least 20 years. Our long-term approach also means we’re bold and willing enough to invest in good relations with everyone who means something to us i.e. our colleagues, suppliers, partners and customers. We believe this makes everything easier and more rewarding. It’s also a sustainable way to run a successful business.
Enduring profitability
When you choose our products you’re making a climate-smart investment that helps achieve a better society. It also has to generate lasting profitability for us and for our customers.
It means that our products must have long service lives, be frequently used and consume the fewest possible resources.
The smarter way to use resources
Our business is based on the use of nature’s resources in a smarter, more sustainable way. It’s in our DNA.
When several people can share one charger, it takes less material and fewer components. Because we use components made from recycled materials of the highest quality to the greatest extent possible, and install them in a protected environment, we’re able to achieve maximum service life with a minimum of environmental impact.

ChargeNode recharges guest EVs at Gothenburg’s new city resort
Gothenburg has its first internationally savvy hotel. Jacy’z Hotel & Resort is the talk of the entire hotel world, far beyond our borders. It aims to give its guests that little extra right up until checkout time, and this includes offering an efficient EV charging system.
EV charging that blends in with the international setting
ESS Group, which has already established 10 different high-class concepts, is raising the bar with Jacy’z Hotel & Resort, a destination for food, relaxation, meetings, fitness and living. And everything comes with an exclusive feel right down to the smallest detail.
Part of this generous package includes offering its guests ChargeNode’s efficient, super-simple EV charging. The installation consists of stylish black beams with a total of 45 charging points split between two levels in the hotel’s parking garage. They are aesthetically pleasing and blend in nicely with the hotel’s internationally savvy design.
“We’re very pleased to enjoy the continued trust of ESS Group. It’s confirmation that we can offer attractive, reliable solutions at the highest level. We’ve already installed half of the planned 45 charging points, and the remainder are in progress,” says Kristian Sandahl, ChargeNode CEO.
"We have very good experience of ChargeNode’s EV charging solutions, as we have installed them at several of our other hotels, so they were the natural choice for Jacy’z Hotel & Resort"
Stefan Jansson, Project Manager, Jacy’z
"It’s extremely valuable for us as a hotel to enable as many EVs as possible to trickle charge for long average periods."
Niklas Jansson, Head of Operations, Jacy’z
The installation in a nutshell
• Stylish black beams with 45 charging points
• Lage scale EV charging system with lower power needs compared to conventional systems
• Engineered to harmonize with the hotel’s savvy design
About ESS Group
Jacy’z Hotel & Resort is ESS Group’s latest and biggest investment. The company was founded in 2007 in conjunction with the acquisition of Ystad Saltsjöbad. Jacy’z is their 11th destination. The company also has 15 restaurants and clubs. Jacy’z Hotel and Resort has 233 rooms, a variety of restaurant and bar concepts, a pool club 100 metres above ground, a large conference facility, a sports club and activities such as billiards and table tennis. It takes its inspiration from 1960s Las Vegas, Miami’s clubs, LA and East Asian metropolises in a modern iteration. It is elegant, bright and airy, and international.

Finally time for Norway to charge in a smart way
We warmly welcome Frode Braaten as Sales & Country Manager for Norway!
With an electrical engineer degree and having spent the last 10 years in the EV charging industry, Frode brings a wealth of experience and will be a perfect fit as ChargeNode establish itself on the Norwegian market.
-When I started in the industry, there were not many electric cars, but when the authorities set goals for electrification of the Norwegian private car fleet for 2025, my interest grew. I have had the pleasure of following and shaping this journey, but it has been commercially challenging to design good solutions at the same pace as the market, technology and standards have developed. To find the best solutions for the domestic market, I have worked with many European manufacturers of both AC and DC solutions. It was when doing some international due diligence that ChargeNode turned up with an exciting mindset on how to meet the need for charging based on an energy-efficient, scalable and sustainable model with a number of advantages: The ability to use available energy in a smart way to charge as many electric cars as possible, opportunity for many charging socket without everyone needing a charging box. Material and aesthetic expression that lasts longer than other solutions. Low operating and ownership costs which guarantee a scalable facility long term. As ChargeNode develops its own software and hardware, we can ensure industry leading functionality and operational stability for users. In addition, we have innovative founders combined an experienced team in Sweden who put their heart and soul into the development of the product and the company. When I got the chance to join, it felt completely natural to follow this exciting journey.
What is the difference between the Swedish and Norwegian markets?
There are both similarities and major differences between the Norwegian and Swedish markets. The biggest difference is probably the total electric car market and the sale of new cars. The market is more mature in Norway and a natural choice when buying a new car. If you combine electric cars and rechargeable hybrids, 22% of all cars in Norway and only 6% in Sweden are chargeable. This means that we have to solve the need for charging, at home, at work and on the roads, and that is not an easy task. I think the need in the Swedish and Norwegian markets is similar, Norway is only a few years ahead  in EV charging roll out. . Among other things, thanks to a favorable incentive program related to the purchase of electric vehicles, the use of electric cars and the establishment of an infrastructure for charging has seen Norway taking the lead globally with Sweden a few years behind.
What challenges do you see in the industry?
The industry is still fairly new and we probably do not see all the challenges yet. Even though we will see great development of energy efficient batteries, there will still be a huge need to charge. To avoid bottlenecks, we must charge when we can, not when we have to. With more and more electric cars, there must be more charging sockets. I also see a major challenge in leveling out energy consumption over a longer period of the day, which will help optimize the existing infrastructure. To meet these challenges, manufacturers and suppliers must be innovative.
Norway has the most electric cars per capita in the world, have you noticed any challenges with that?
Norway has become a kind of test market for everyone who has a solution for electric car use. All innovations are unfortunately not well designed or sustainable long term. Although Norway has a high density of electric cars, Norway is a small market with several challenges to address. We do not know how well solutions developed across the globe works in Norway. We also see that we have challenges related to the electric car density in urban areas, where today’s technology is unable to meet the demand for electric car charging.
How big is the need for scalable EV charging in Norway?
Today, we have many 1st and 2nd generation solutions that no longer cover the need for todays EV charging and since our car fleet has an average age of over 10 years, the number of electric cars will continue to grow exponentially. I would argue that scalable electric car charging will be a key factor for the future if we want to continue grow at this pace and not overload the energy grid. The need is huge.
What are your expectations when ChargeNode is launched on the Norwegian market?
I look forward to inform the Norwegian market how ChargeNodes scalable charging technology can solve many challenges and enable more people to charge. I expect us to grow and become a significant player, just like in Sweden.
What is best about ChargeNodes charging technology?
The ChargeNode charging station, centrally located where all expensive and operational components are safely located, while type 2 sockets are installed at the parking lot. Other advantages are the simple app and charging portal that prioritizes the power in the system dynamically between 3 and 22kW to dedicated charging nodes prioritized according to departure needs and finally the simple payment methods combined with a solid service promise.
What will be the next step for the Norwegian market?
It is important that we can quickly establish ourselves in Norway and inform the Norwegian market about ChargeNodes innovative and unique charging technology. We need to establish offices with more resources in sales while also building collaborations and partnerships in the market. We want to be a player with an active presence for our customers and partners in Norway.

Jointly owned property chooses ChargeNode
As the number of EV owners rose, a jointly owned property association (Stora Sjöfallets Samfällighetsförening) in Norra Djurgården, Stockholm, realized it was high time to install more charging sockets. Following a thorough market survey, they chose ChargeNode. Largely because it was a simple, flexible and cost-effective solution.
When the property association decided to invest seriously in a modern EV charging solution, there were not all that many association members charging cars. But pretty soon after the 15 old charging boxes had been taken down and replaced with ChargeNode’s solution, EV usage grew significantly. Today, almost 30 spaces are used every month. This constitutes a very healthy 25%.
Before the association decided on a supplier, it carried out a survey among its members which showed that half of them plan to acquire an EV within three years. Before procuring a charging system, they prepared extensive project data, calculated their requirements, and naturally checked references.
"The collaboration was excellent throughout the project, from contract signing to system operation"
Björn Fridbom, Sjöfallet housing association
There were a number of criteria that were distinctly to ChargeNode’s advantage. Costs were naturally one; there were no fixed fees, and the long service life kept total ownership costs low. Simplicity was equally as important. There was a minimum of admin for the association, and it was also easy to process payments. It’s also easy for people charging their cars – the app is as clear as crystal and there’s no need to worry about finding a special charging point. Other advantages include distance monitoring, remote control and dynamic, smart load-balancing. What’s more, the installation is stylish and attractive.
The garage is shared with Wallenstam, which has the most places, and three tenant-owner associations, all of which removed old charging boxes of various makes to install a total of 117 charging sockets from ChargeNode – one per parking space. Installing this number of charging points on a single occasion has given the parking garage a distinct green profile.
"Installing this many charging sockets in the same garage was more practical and profitable for the association. It also raises the value of our properties."
Björn Fridbom, Sjöfallet housing association
The installation in a nutshell
• 15 old charging boxes of various makes replaced with a uniform solution.
• 4 central centralised charging cabinets that controls all charging in the garage.
• 117 charging points in a aluminium power bar. One charging point per parking bay.
About Sjöfallet housing association
Samfällighetsförening Stora Sjöfallet is located in Norra Djurgården, Stockholm; it is a jointly owned property with a garage. Formed in 2014, it is owned by Wallenstam and three different housing associations. The housing association property comprises two buildings completed in 2016 with a total of 64 apartments and two other premises.

The Blue building with green ambitions
By making conscious, long-term choices, Blå Huset has created a property that focuses on reducing the consumption of resources. Part of this work included installing EV charging for employees, customers and visitors.
EV charging for businesses.
And the future.
Blå Huset understood early on that there was a great need for EV charging, something that was also in line with the office block’s conscious environmental profile. It soon became an important issue.
“We’re aware of the impact we have on the environment and climate,” says Blå Huset’s Mattias Feldt. “Which is why it’s so important for us to stay ahead of the game. Within five years, 80% of company vehicles will almost certainly be hybrid or EVs. It’s also why we chose to install 53 charging sockets with integrated outlets in our car park. By making EV charging available in as many parking bays as possible, we will enable customers to avoid moving their cars around during working hours.”
"ChargeNode’s software and hardware provided us with an economically advantageous solution with many parking bays and cutting-edge technology."
Mattias Feldt, Blå Huset
Offering charging points is a no-brainer
“The work from contract to system commissioning with various design solutions for charging EVs went very smoothly,” continued Mattias. “Something our customers appreciate. Our customer portal gives us a good overview, and our employees and visitors find the app very easy to use. We’ve future-proofed things in a pretty smart way. Offering many charging points will be a must in the future. People will take EV charging at workplaces for granted. This means electricity companies will have to expand their networks, which is a challenge.”
The installation in a nutshell
A stylish end-to-end solution with power bar, bollards and specially designed recessed sockets in lamp posts.
53 charging sockets
Hardware painted black to provide a sober impression.
Blå Huset
Blå Huset is located in Lockarp just outside of Malmö. It is a newly built office block with the vision of being Malmö’s most modern, environmentally efficient office in an area characterised by burgeoning growth. It has had its challenges, ranging from the choice of materials to energy use and the ability of employees and visitors to the office to help reduce the long-term environmental impact. The building is owned by Blå Huset AB. One of the tenants is electricity installer APQ El AB, which naturally demands high standards of efficiency, user-friendliness and design.
