“I have been working with WPO for over 2 years and I currently assist the Health & Safety department with HV works including reviewing RAMS. During this period, I have worked on all the Irish windfarms that WPO manages, which gives me good knowledge of the sites across the country.
I enjoy the challenges that come with the day-to-day management of wind farms both technically and conceptually, since they are at the heart of the energy transition the world so badly needs.
I also enjoy the opportunities WPO constantly offers to add new qualifications and skills to its team members. After working for over 28 years in the electrical and mechanical environment, I still believe that I can always learn something new and I welcome the opportunities the company offers me.”
Stephen Albury, Site Services Manager - Sweden
“I’ve been a member of the WPO family for 3 years now, and it’s still as exciting today as the day I started! I enjoyed and had great work colleagues at my previous job, but I was given the opportunity to join WPO and took that opportunity as I believed in their core business as true independent Asset Managers. I haven’t looked back and am still very much excited about it.
Since I started at WPO, I’ve had the opportunity, together with HR, to select and hire my own Site Service Coordinators group. With the support from the whole WPO team, we have now successfully secured a solid base in Sweden.
