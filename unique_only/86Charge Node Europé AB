Worthwhile questions
Learn more about our charging technology
Centralised charging technology
Well, how about a scalable charging solution with a long service life and depreciation time? A smaller power supply cable compared to conventional charging box solutions. And a super-smart charging system where sensitive electrical components are gathered together and protected in a sturdy charging cabinet. In an installation free from groundwork. And last but not least, minimal maintenance.
Smart control
Choose between billing based on user consumption (number of kWh) and/or on a fixed price (standard) per month. If you prefer to look after billing yourself, invoice templates are available from our cloud service.
Our scalable charging system
”ESS Group and Ellery Beach House chose ChargeNode because the company understood us, our guests and our challenges right away. The system was impressive from day one and in our experience, they demonstrated a fundamentally genuine interest in the environment and in us as a company. A great combination that bodes well for a long-term partnership.”
By offering EV charging, you’re making a conscious, eco-friendly choice to help the transition to a fossil-free society.
Innovative and optimised
Our customer recommendations
Lower power requirement
1. More revenue, less work
EVs rarely need to charge more than 2–3 hours. But in tenant-owner associations, they’re often parked for a long while, especially at night. Installing a charging box in every parking bay and maybe having to invest in a larger power supply cable from the mains is not particularly cost-effective.
Stylish and eco-friendly
Because multiple vehicles share a single charging cabinet, investment costs, the amount of expensive materials and environmental impact are all reduced. The difference is enormous compared to conventional charging systems, where each parking bay requires its own charging box.
See customer installations
Our sturdy charging cabinets can be installed in many ways, both indoors and out. Many customers choose to install trunking, i.e. a hollow rail available in many colours that runs in front of the parking bays. This requires no ground works. The outlets can also be installed in lighting bollards or directly on walls / façades. Smart and stylish.
Our smart cloud services let you monitor access, operation and invoicing. Visitors control charging and our easy-to-use app makes payment simple.
2. More satisfied visitors
3. Strengthen your brand. And save the environment.
What else will your charging system need?
Interested?
Why should I choose the charging system from ChargeNode?
Sales Director & Partner
Can our electrical system handle charging?
With our stylish power bar solution, you’ll avoid cable laying and expensive groundwork.
Why you should choose us
Yes. Because our charging system’s output is optimised through load-balancing (3.0), it can be installed in all properties. This means our charging system will never overload the electrical system.
Offer charging and bill users in the same way as for parking. You choose the electricity surcharge, we take care of operations and customer payments.
The climate leap initiative will be reintroduced for visitor chargers in public spaces and there is a new subsidy for non-public charging. The subsidies cover up to 50% of the investment.
Use our smart cloud services to set prices and manage access, operation and billing.
Let’s tell you more
Visitors who leave fully charged will return. They’ll choose you instead of places without charging facilities.
Guaranteed, end-to-end solution
How do we install a ChargeNode charging system?
How do we (tenant-owner associations, companies, car parks etc.) bill our customers?
It will need hard-wire access to the internet and a 16 A or greater supply cable, depending on the rate of use.
Users control charging and pay via our simple app.
Carl Lundgren
Fully charged with super-smart control
Our innovative charging technology distributes available output from a central charging cabinet to the connected vehicles. Because charging is optimised for each EV’s parking time, charge requirement and battery capacity, up to 54 vehicles can share a single charging cabinet, and each vehicle can charge at up to 22 kW. What’s more, the system can be scaled up to hundreds of charging points.
Minimal groundwork
WOW
Charging means new revenues
Super-smart, worry-free!
Three smart reasons to offer charging
With our patent-pending charging system you enjoy worry-free ownership, a 10-year depreciation period and the lowest total cost.
ESS Group
A single sturdy charging cabinet can charge up to 54 cars. Each parking bay only needs one charging socket with an output of up to 22 kW. The system can be scaled up to hundreds of charging points.
Get in touch and we’ll tell you more and help you through the application process.
Here are more smart thinkers
I’d really like your help!
We can take care of all user billing. Users register their payment cards in our app and are then debited monthly or on each occasion they charge their vehicle. Easy peasy.
Our end-to-end solution includes planning, installation, operation and payment solutions, always with a 3-year warranty. You can bank on a service life of at least 20 years.
Our solution only requires one charging socket for each parking bay. This allows the outlets to be neatly and discreetly integrated into your parking environment.
Durable and reliable
With smart optimisation and output sharing, 35-63A (3-phase) is ample in large buildings. Fuse protection and load-balancing with your building are of course included.
All sensitive electronics are separated from the charging sockets and brought together in a central charging cabinet with the highest IP Rating. The charging cabinets are manufactured in Sweden using standard components of very high quality. This makes for a reliable charging environment and a service life of more than 20 years. And for the sake of your peace of mind, all of our installations come with a 3-year warranty.

				<p>ESS Group, which has already established 10 different high-class concepts, is raising the bar with Jacy’z Hotel &amp; Resort, a destination for food, relaxation, meetings, fitness and living. And everything comes with an exclusive feel right down to the smallest detail.</p>
<p>Part of this generous package includes offering its guests ChargeNode’s efficient, super-simple EV charging. The installation consists of stylish black beams with a total of 45 charging points split between two levels in the hotel’s parking garage. They are aesthetically pleasing and blend in nicely with the hotel’s internationally savvy design.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re very pleased to enjoy the continued trust of ESS Group. It’s confirmation that we can offer attractive, reliable solutions at the highest level. We’ve already installed half of the planned 45 charging points, and the remainder are in progress,&#8221; says Kristian Sandahl, ChargeNode CEO.</p>

<p>As the number of EV owners rose, a jointly owned property association (Stora Sjöfallets Samfällighetsförening) in Norra Djurgården, Stockholm, realized it was high time to install more charging sockets. Following a thorough market survey, they chose ChargeNode. Largely because it was a simple, flexible and cost-effective solution.</p>

				-When I started in the industry, there were not many electric cars, but when the authorities set goals for electrification of the Norwegian private car fleet for 2025, my interest grew. I have had the pleasure of following and shaping this journey, but it has been commercially challenging to design good solutions at the same pace as the market, technology and standards have developed. To find the best solutions for the domestic market, I have worked with many European manufacturers of both AC and DC solutions. It was when doing some international due diligence that ChargeNode turned up with an exciting mindset on how to meet the need for charging based on an energy-efficient, scalable and sustainable model with a number of advantages: The ability to use available energy in a smart way to charge as many electric cars as possible, opportunity for many charging socket without everyone needing a charging box. Material and aesthetic expression that lasts longer than other solutions. Low operating and ownership costs which guarantee a scalable facility long term. As ChargeNode develops its own software and hardware, we can ensure industry leading functionality and operational stability for users. In addition, we have innovative founders combined an experienced team in Sweden who put their heart and soul into the development of the product and the company. When I got the chance to join, it felt completely natural to follow this exciting journey.					</div>

				<strong>What is the difference between the Swedish and Norwegian markets?</strong>
<br>
There are both similarities and major differences between the Norwegian and Swedish markets. The biggest difference is probably the total electric car market and the sale of new cars. The market is more mature in Norway and a natural choice when buying a new car. If you combine electric cars and rechargeable hybrids, 22% of all cars in Norway and only 6% in Sweden are chargeable. This means that we have to solve the need for charging, at home, at work and on the roads, and that is not an easy task. I think the need in the Swedish and Norwegian markets is similar, Norway is only a few years ahead  in EV charging roll out. . Among other things, thanks to a favorable incentive program related to the purchase of electric vehicles, the use of electric cars and the establishment of an infrastructure for charging has seen Norway taking the lead globally with Sweden a few years behind.
<br><br>
<strong>What challenges do you see in the industry?</strong>
<br>
The industry is still fairly new and we probably do not see all the challenges yet. Even though we will see great development of energy efficient batteries, there will still be a huge need to charge. To avoid bottlenecks, we must charge when we can, not when we have to. With more and more electric cars, there must be more charging sockets. I also see a major challenge in leveling out energy consumption over a longer period of the day, which will help optimize the existing infrastructure. To meet these challenges, manufacturers and suppliers must be innovative.
<br><br>
<strong>Norway has the most electric cars per capita in the world, have you noticed any challenges with that?</strong>
<br>
Norway has become a kind of test market for everyone who has a solution for electric car use. All innovations are unfortunately not well designed or sustainable long term. Although Norway has a high density of electric cars, Norway is a small market with several challenges to address. We do not know how well solutions developed across the globe works in Norway. We also see that we have challenges related to the electric car density in urban areas, where today&#8217;s technology is unable to meet the demand for electric car charging.
<br><br>
<strong>How big is the need for scalable EV charging in Norway?</strong>
<br>
Today, we have many 1st and 2nd generation solutions that no longer cover the need for todays EV charging and since our car fleet has an average age of over 10 years, the number of electric cars will continue to grow exponentially. I would argue that scalable electric car charging will be a key factor for the future if we want to continue grow at this pace and not overload the energy grid. The need is huge.
<br><br>
<strong>What are your expectations when ChargeNode is launched on the Norwegian market?</strong>
<br>
I look forward to inform the Norwegian market how ChargeNodes scalable charging technology can solve many challenges and enable more people to charge. I expect us to grow and become a significant player, just like in Sweden.
<br><br>
<strong>What is best about ChargeNodes charging technology?</strong>
<br>
The ChargeNode charging station, centrally located where all expensive and operational components are safely located, while type 2 sockets are installed at the parking lot. Other advantages are the simple app and charging portal that prioritizes the power in the system dynamically between 3 and 22kW to dedicated charging nodes prioritized according to departure needs and finally the simple payment methods combined with a solid service promise.
<br><br>
<strong>What will be the next step for the Norwegian market?</strong>
<br>
It is important that we can quickly establish ourselves in Norway and inform the Norwegian market about ChargeNodes innovative and unique charging technology. We need to establish offices with more resources in sales while also building collaborations and partnerships in the market. We want to be a player with an active presence for our customers and partners in Norway.					</div>

				<p>As the number of EV owners rose, a jointly owned property association (Stora Sjöfallets Samfällighetsförening) in Norra Djurgården, Stockholm, realized it was high time to install more charging sockets. Following a thorough market survey, they chose ChargeNode. Largely because it was a simple, flexible and cost-effective solution.</p>

				<p>When the property association decided to invest seriously in a modern EV charging solution, there were not all that many association members charging cars. But pretty soon after the 15 old charging boxes had been taken down and replaced with ChargeNode’s solution, EV usage grew significantly. Today, almost 30 spaces are used every month. This constitutes a very healthy 25%.</p>

				<p>There were a number of criteria that were distinctly to ChargeNode’s advantage. Costs were naturally one; there were no fixed fees, and the long service life kept total ownership costs low. Simplicity was equally as important. There was a minimum of admin for the association, and it was also easy to process payments. It’s also easy for people charging their cars – the app is as clear as crystal and there’s no need to worry about finding a special charging point. Other advantages include distance monitoring, remote control and dynamic, smart load-balancing. What’s more, the installation is stylish and attractive.</p>
<p>The garage is shared with Wallenstam, which has the most places, and three tenant-owner associations, all of which removed old charging boxes of various makes to install a total of 117 charging sockets from ChargeNode – one per parking space. Installing this number of charging points on a single occasion has given the parking garage a distinct green profile.</p>

				<p>Blå Huset understood early on that there was a great need for EV charging, something that was also in line with the office block’s conscious environmental profile. It soon became an important issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re aware of the impact we have on the environment and climate,&#8221; says Blå Huset’s Mattias Feldt. &#8220;Which is why it’s so important for us to stay ahead of the game. Within five years, 80% of company vehicles will almost certainly be hybrid or EVs. It’s also why we chose to install 53 charging sockets with integrated outlets in our car park. By making EV charging available in as many parking bays as possible, we will enable customers to avoid moving their cars around during working hours.&#8221;</p>

ChargeNode offers a scalable charging system based on trailblazing, innovative charging technology. A sturdy charging unit that can charge up to 54 EVs is installed indoors or in an electrical cabinet. Only one charging socket is installed at each parking bay.
Bollard - ChargeNode
, one of Sweden?s most illustrious companies when it comes to luminaires. Together we created stylish lighting bollards with integrated charging sockets that create electrifying surroundings in more ways than one.
Sturdy, scalable charging
Quality that pays over the long term...
… in a design that will stand the test of time. Add to this the depreciation time of 10 years and a 20-year estimated component service life and you get a solution that will have an unbeatable lifetime cost.
Our smart software controls and distributes charging between charging sockets in real time and balances output with the property?s other output requirements. In this way, everyone in the association can safely charge without blowing the main fuse.
Also, because our charging technology consumes less power, you enjoy lower electrical operating costs.
? Our cloud service makes it easy for associations to provide access, monitor operations, see electricity consumption per user and bill them.
Easy-to-use app & cloud service
Super-smart and elegant, or what?
All in one. Charging, lighting and elegant parking.
Let?s tell you more
Sound too good to be true? Then let?s tell you more.
Not very elegant at all. So we took our patent-pending charging technology and teamed up with
Users can easily download our app to activate and control charging.
Westal
And if you allow guests to charge their EVs, our app makes it easy for them to activate and pay for charging. You get to choose whether to add a surcharge for the electricity.
Just how elegant are plastic charging boxes at every parking bay?

This is more or less how we’d describe our trailblazing charging technology. More specifically, our patent-pending charging technology means many vehicles share a single centralised charging unit that distributes power based on parking time and charging needs.
Only the charging sockets are located at each parking bay, and in this way you avoid installing expensive charging boxes at every bay.
We simply call it
An elegant, climate-smart aluminium trunking with charging sockets for everyone.
Our cloud service makes it easy for associations to provide access, monitor operations, see electricity consumption per user and bill users.
Climate-smart in more ways than one
Power bar solution - ChargeNode
EV charging with multiple sockets
The Power Bar
Our smart power bar solution can be installed on a wall, as bollards or handrails on ground screws. Hidden in the bushes or underground, our power bar is at home anywhere.
Upright or horizontal?
See more installations
Driving an EV is climate-smart, but our proprietary power bar solution manufactured from green, recycled aluminium makes it even smarter. What’s more, our solution has a service life of at least 20 years.
We very recently installed 30 outlets in Opalparken just outside Gothenburg in a top-quality, modern multi-story car park that demanded modern EV charging.
And because all the cabling is hidden away in ducting, you also avoid expensive ground works.

News - ChargeNode
As the number of EV owners rose, a jointly owned property association (Stora Sjöfallets Samfällighetsförening) in Norra Djurgården, Stockholm, realized it was high time to install more charging sockets. Following a thorough market survey, they chose ChargeNode. Largely because it was a simple, flexible and cost-effective solution.

About Sjöfallet housing association
Jointly owned property chooses ChargeNode - ChargeNode
Before the association decided on a supplier, it carried out a survey among its members which showed that half of them plan to acquire an EV within three years. Before procuring a charging system, they prepared extensive project data, calculated their requirements, and naturally checked references.
• 117 charging points in a aluminium power bar. One charging point per parking bay.
"Installing this many charging sockets in the same garage was more practical and profitable for the association. It also raises the value of our properties."
"The collaboration was excellent throughout the project, from contract signing to system operation"
The installation in a nutshell
Samfällighetsförening Stora Sjöfallet is located in Norra Djurgården, Stockholm; it is a jointly owned property with a garage. Formed in 2014, it is owned by Wallenstam and three different housing associations. The housing association property comprises two buildings completed in 2016 with a total of 64 apartments and two other premises.
There were a number of criteria that were distinctly to ChargeNode’s advantage. Costs were naturally one; there were no fixed fees, and the long service life kept total ownership costs low. Simplicity was equally as important. There was a minimum of admin for the association, and it was also easy to process payments. It’s also easy for people charging their cars – the app is as clear as crystal and there’s no need to worry about finding a special charging point. Other advantages include distance monitoring, remote control and dynamic, smart load-balancing. What’s more, the installation is stylish and attractive.
Björn Fridbom, Sjöfallet housing association
When the property association decided to invest seriously in a modern EV charging solution, there were not all that many association members charging cars. But pretty soon after the 15 old charging boxes had been taken down and replaced with ChargeNode’s solution, EV usage grew significantly. Today, almost 30 spaces are used every month. This constitutes a very healthy 25%.
The garage is shared with Wallenstam, which has the most places, and three tenant-owner associations, all of which removed old charging boxes of various makes to install a total of 117 charging sockets from ChargeNode – one per parking space. Installing this number of charging points on a single occasion has given the parking garage a distinct green profile.
December 20, 2022
• 15 old charging boxes of various makes replaced with a uniform solution.
• 4 central centralised charging cabinets that controls all charging in the garage.

When he later had to queue to charge his EV in a major public car park that only had three charging boxes, all of which were occupied, he realised that there must be a smarter way to charge multiple vehicles without installing expensive charging boxes in every parking bay. With his excellent knowledge of charging times, Kristian also realised that most EVs were parked for much longer than it took to charge them fully. From these two insights, the idea was conceived to let multiple parking bays share charging capacity.
In 2016

Charge Node Europé AB’s (”ChargeNode”) General Terms and Conditions for users regarding the ChargeNode battery charging service.
§A Function and use of the ChargeNode payment solution
Charging capacity depends on multiple factors, such as the technical characteristics of the electric vehicle, the level of charge in the vehicle battery and charging station capacity. The component with the lowest capacity will determine the output the electric vehicle can accept. ChargeNode cannot guarantee that charging an electric vehicle will be possible within any maximum specified time limit or at a minimum output. Furthermore, battery charging ordered through the ChargeNode app places users in a charging queue, based on the charge required and departure time. Because loads vary at any given time, the User cannot be guaranteed a certain charge. However, the User will only pay for the charge received.
Battery charging with ChargeNode: The User may start and stop charging by using the matching smartphone application – prior registration is required as described under §3.
Users can receive information free of charge once a year about the processing of personal data relating to them. Users may also request that personal data that has not been processed in accordance with applicable law be rectified, blocked or erased. Further information about personal data at ChargeNode is available at www.chargenode.eu/privacypolicy.
The User’s obligation to pay: When the User registers his or her payment card, ChargeNode has the task of collecting fees incurred through the use of charging stations, and service fees on behalf of business partners. A demand for repayment by the User arising from challenges or claims in respect of services received will be denied after the deadline set in §C 3.
These terms and conditions apply to the agreement until further notice. ChargeNode has the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect if the User violates these terms and conditions or uses the Service or a charging station in such a way as to cause nuisance or damage to ChargeNode.
As a rule, personal data is not disclosed to companies in countries outside the EU or EEA. Should this nevertheless occur, ChargeNode will make sure all legal conditions are met.
The User must also make sure that his or her user account cannot be used or misused by unauthorized persons.
The User acknowledges that ChargeNode may, subject to the same terms and conditions, transfer in whole or in part its rights and obligations under this Agreement to another company within the same Group or to another party which may reasonably be expected to fulfil the obligations under this Agreement in a satisfactory manner.
ChargeNode reserves the right, without compensation to the User, to change, limit access to, or suspend the Service or charging station for such things as updates, maintenance and repair or as a result of force majeure.
Payment method details
The User’s legal claims remain unaffected by this.
§11 Amending terms and conditions
SE 438 91 Landvetter
The User must comply with all policies and requirements in accordance with the instructions issued by ChargeNode from time to time. This includes making sure that the electric vehicle used by the User in conjunction with the Service meets all charging requirements.
General terms and conditions - ChargeNode
ChargeNode endeavours to keep charging stations in the ChargeNode network operational to the greatest extent possible. Should a charging station suffer a technical fault, ChargeNode will try to correct the fault as quickly as possible.
ChargeNode has the right to amend these terms and conditions provided that the User is notified of the amendment via the App or by email at least 14 days prior to its taking effect. In such cases, the User will be deemed notified two days after the email is sent or the update is made known in the app.
The app only applies to charging stations that are part of the ChargeNode network. The network includes public and non-public charging stations. Every instance of the app confers the right to charge batteries at public charging stations, but may be restricted in non-public locations depending on the charging station owner’s setup.

”For us, it made sense not to set up charging boxes but to go for a centralised charging system from ChargeNode instead. The beautiful natural surroundings that frame our golf, conference and hotel resort are unique and I’m more than happy for us to do our bit in the green transition. ChargeNode was the natural choice as we were looking for something that was sustainable, durable and which blended well into our surroundings.”

Our patent-pending charge technology in a nutshell
Our dynamic charging technology and smart algorithms calculate the charging order and output to each EV. In this way, available output is concentrated or distributed to connected EVs based on a number of parameters. An EV parked for a short while can receive maximum output, while one parked for longer can make do with lower.
It’s easy to download the app and activate charging. Any payment is also made in the app.
No matter how good a charging box design may be, it’s still just a box, usually plastic, mounted on a post or a wall. But ChargeNode technology makes all the boxes disappear completely. Instead, only the charging sockets are installed at each parking bay, and these can be fully integrated into your surroundings e.g. in
3-year warranty. Estimated service life of at least 20 years.
3. Our charging technology offers 16-63A circuit breakers or load-balancing with the property and can deliver up to 22 kW per charging socket.
We take overall responsibility for hardware, software, installation, operation, billing and support. No unexpected costs.
Eco-friendly
Super-smart charging for more EVs
Scalable
Fewer components = lower environmental impact. What’s more, the estimated 20-year service life means it will be a long, long while before your charging system needs replacing.
A single ChargeNode cabinet can supply up to 54 charging sockets. Which means the same number of EVs can be parked and recharged. Our charging technology is future-proof and easy to scale up to handle hundreds of charging sockets.
Our innovation
2. Our super-smart software optimises and distributes available output based on the number of connected EVs, departure times, vehicle charging capacity and the desired charge. Everyone gets charged without your having to raise the property’s power rating.

Things to remember when investing in a charger - ChargeNode
Remember to save all your receipts. You will need them when you submit your application for a grant.
What to do when you apply for a grant to purchase an EV charging system.
Because different EVs have different connectors, it’s important to plan the type or types of charging connectors to offer. The EU has decided that the Type 2 connector will be the standard for normal and semi-fast charging. The CCS connector will be the standard for fast charging. Follow these guidelines and you can’t go wrong.
As many estate agents will confirm, there is greater interest among potential buyers for associations with charging points.
The grant covers half of the cost of materials including the charging station and the labour costs for installing it. The maximum grant per property is SEK 10,000. According to the Swedish EPA, the term ‘property’ refers to the designation in the Land Register.
If the installation was already completed when the application was submitted, the application for payment and the required appendices must be lodged with the EPA no later than three months from the decision date.
At home
Setting up a charging system is a simple process when done in the correct order. Planning, procurement, installation and maintenance. Before you begin the procurement process and apply for planning permission, you need to check the items below. If you need guidance, we’ll be happy to help.
Make sure everyone involved such as the landowner, parking companies and the municipality is in agreement.
Because old or defective connections and cable outlets in a property can overheat under load, which in turn may lead to fire, you should let an electrical installation company check your electrical installation.
Labour costs eligible for a grant apply only to those works carried out by a person approved for F-tax (sole trader tax).
When you purchase a connected charger you can be sure your installation is future-proofed. And the socket, the physical Type 2 connector, is of the European standard that will be mandatory in the future. As a supplier, we will also continue developing services in addition to those available in the cloud. In the future, this will allow you to control your charging based on the electricity price.
What should you consider when investing in an EV charging system at home?
Can I charge using the engine heater circuit or electrical socket?
Many associations have already installed charging points and many are planning to increase the number of points. It’s a good idea to contact an association that’s already installed charging points for help and advice. We promise, there’s a great deal of interest.
Smarter, safer and faster. And convenient.
Example: If you live in an apartment block, you share the property designation with your neighbours. The Swedish EPA may only pay out SEK 10,000 per property.
The application must always be made in two steps.
Check the demand and possibilities right now
Jointly owned properties
The charging station must be installed in a property the applicant owns or lawfully occupies. If you live in a property you do not own, you must append verification from the property owner that you have permission to install a charging station on the property. This could e.g. be a certificate from the board of the tenant-owner association.
Eligible cost refers to the material and labour costs required to install the charging point, such as the cost of charging posts or charging boxes, cable laying, installation works and mains connection.
Once you have submitted a preliminary application, you have 12 months in which to complete the measures. Once the measures are completed, the final application must be submitted within 3 months.
Review the association’s requirement and think long-term so that your solution can grow as the demand for charging increases. Check the property’s fusing. If you lack this information, the electrical mains owner can help you.
The amount of energy per unit of time transferred while charging a battery electric vehicle. The unit for output is the kilowatt, kW.
The ‘Ladda bilen’ (Charge your car) investment subsidy from the Swedish EPA is aimed at tenant-owner associations and jointly owned properties that wish to install charging points for their own personal use.
The EPA’s decision states whether or not the grant for the measures is approved. In order to request payment, you must first receive approval. The grant remains in the system until you submit the ‘Request for payment’ form, however not for more than 12 months.
Extension leads must not be used as there is a risk that the fuse will not offer proper protection. Also, if the control box or extension lead ends up on the ground, they can easily be damaged. Never use equipment between the socket and the charger cable.
Request for payment
See our installations
Economic support is available through the government environmental initiative when you install an EV charging system. Private individuals who own or lawfully occupy a property may apply for a grant for an EV charging station.
Here are a few other reasons why tenant-owner associations should install charging points for EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs.
Because the charger senses output via the main circuit breaker, your house will be smarter and so will your total electrical situation. It means you will no longer have to increase your circuit breaker size and raise your basic electricity charge just because you own a chargeable vehicle. The charger simply balances the load for the entire household.
The distance a battery electric vehicle can travel on a single charge. Range is affected by e.g. topography, temperature, speed and acceleration.
More and more people are choosing EVs, and the best place to charge them is at home where they usually park. It’s safe, secure and convenient.
What are the advantages of installing an EV charging system at home?
The installation must be performed by an electrical installation company or electrical installer as intended by the Swedish Electrical Safety Act, i.e. a trader who carries out electrical installation works in a professional capacity and where the installer is authorised to carry out such works.
Raises the value of apartments
Decide on how to take payment or if charging should be free.
Yes, but it’s not recommended as there are safety risks. But if you have access to an engine heater socket in your house or through the landlord you’re well on your way to safely charging your EV. In fact, it’s relatively easy to remove the engine heater post and replace it with a charging station instead.
And the weather?
Driving an EV is kinder on the wallet than a fossil-fuelled car. But if you don’t have your own charging system it’s easy to end up in a downward spiral. When you charge your car at charging stations that lack efficient charging, where the system is poorly optimised and charging costs quickly get out of hand, you soon lose control of your charging costs.
A short glossary for EV enthusiasts
The grant is paid as a lump sum. The maximum possible grant is 50 per cent of the eligible cost, however not more than SEK 15,000 per charging point.
Choosing the right connector.
New, as of 2021 – The green deduction
There are many advantages in being one step ahead. It can be a problem if an association is unable to provide charging facilities. There is a risk of fire when charging via a regular wall plug, and of ugly alterations to the ground and external walls when residents perform the work at their own expense.
If the jointly owned property’s facility order does not cover EV charging, the association may apply to the National Land Survey for a review. The chances of getting a review increase if everyone is in agreement about making the change and for charging stations to be included in the facility.
Tenant-owner associations
More people are driving EVs and want to charge at home
The application for a grant
The National Electrical Safety Board advises against regular charging through conventional wall sockets and engine heater sockets.
EV
Submit your application here
A vehicle with two different types of engines, one of which is an electric motor. The plug-in hybrid’s electric motors take power from a battery that is charged from the mains.
Decide on how customers should have access to charging, e.g. via a mobile app, code or RFID tag. Or should they be open to the public?
If there’s one thing we have no control over in Sweden it’s the weather, and as you know it can get pretty cold here. That’s why we use equipment that is tested for our climate. And you avoid charging cables that have frozen stiff.
Save time and make everyday life more efficient.
All you need to do is run a power cable and install the charging system. It’s a simple job performed by a certified electrical installer. It’s important to check with your power company whether there is sufficient output available in the property and/or the area.
Connectors and safety
The right way to prepare for your investment in a super-smart charging system
Decide on the right charging speed and connectors. Also, consider profiling and peripheral equipment for the charging system.
Commercial properties
As the number of EVs rises, so too does the need for charging points. And the best charging location is where you usually park. It’s why more and more tenant-owner associations are investing in charging points so that all of the association’s residents can have access to charging.
The application for payment and the required appendices must be lodged with the Swedish EPA within three months of completion of the installation.
Range anxiety
More associations are installing charging points
The economic aspect
Compared to a house, calculating electricity consumption in a tenant-owner association is a little more difficult. But there are various ways. Smart charging systems have software that keeps tabs on who is charging and their electricity consumption. Some charging systems can even take care of billing. Otherwise, it’s easy for the association to calculate each member’s consumption from the charging system and then invoice this. If the charging system cannot meter consumption, the association can add a standard charge for electricity to the garage rent, or members can sign their own agreement with their electricity provider.
Having a fixed installation at home is convenient.
Fully charging an EV can take 10–11 hours using a regular electrical socket. In principle, this means you must charge your car from the moment you get home until it’s time to leave for work the following morning. This leaves no room for running other errands. A conventional electrical socket is not able to fully provide the right electrical capacity. There is a risk that your battery will be empty when it’s time to leave for work. Or you can install a charging system and get a good night’s sleep before driving to work the next day with a fully charged battery. Why take the risk?
Electric vehicle; the designation for a vehicle that uses electric motors instead of a conventional internal combustion engine.
The fear of running out of charge in a battery electric vehicle before reaching the next charging station.
Who pays for the electricity?
It’s easy to install
Different rechargeable vehicles uses different connectors, so it’s obviously important that the charging station connector is the right one for your car. But in principle, the following applies: Type 1 and Type 2 connectors are for normal charging, while CCS and CHAdeMO connectors are used for fast charging. The EU has stipulated that Type 2 and CCS connectors will be the standards. Make sure the charging station meets the Mode 3 safety level, also an EU standard.
The decision to approve the grant is valid for a maximum of one year. This means the costs must be verified within one year.
The state will bear half of the cost
A simple form of wall-mounted charging station primarily produced for normal charging in EVs at home.
When a jointly owned property forms a shared parking facility, the National Land Survey draws up a facility order. It describes such things as which buildings may use the parking facility, its size and details such as the ability to connect charging stations.
If you’re uncertain what the existing facility order includes, you can request a property definition order from the National Land Survey. This means the National Land Survey will make a legally binding interpretation if the desired changes are within the scope of the jointly owned property’s existing facility order.
Good to know when you’re investing in EV charging
The jointly owned property may make its own decision regarding EV charging
Charging box
You can apply for the grant before or after the installation is completed. If the application is made after the installation is completed, it must be lodged with the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency within six months of the installation’s completion date.
Find the best place for the charging system. Consider who should have access.
We’ve made great technical advances and these days it’s easier and cheaper to install charging systems. More and more property owners are showcasing their pioneering credentials and contributing to a better climate by offering their tenants EV charging. The green factor plays a part in the choice of premises for many companies. We’re all aware that we must reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the Swedish vehicle park. Sweden’s property owners have an enormously important part to play in the transition to electrification. Investing in charging systems is the only way to go, not only business wise, but also in terms of the environment.
Grants may only be made for charging points installed on a property owned or lawfully occupied by the applicant.
Think about the future
Connected chargers make smart functions possible.
How to apply for a grant when purchasing an EV charging system.
You can apply to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency for financial support with half of the investment cost. You can recoup the rest of the cost by raising the parking fee. A smart climate investment at no additional cost to the association.
Facility orders control what jointly owned properties may do with their installations. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to draw any general conclusions as to whether the charging points are included among permitted measures. Every jointly owned property’s facility order must be interpreted individually.
As of the new year it will be cheaper to buy and install a charging box at home. The green deduction works in precisely the same way as the RUT and ROT deduction for certain repair works and conversions etc. This means you no longer need to apply for a grant from the Swedish EPA retroactively as the deduction is already made when you receive your invoice.
Plug-in hybrid
Review the facility order if necessary
As a property owner, what should I bear in mind?
Conventional wall sockets and engine heater sockets (Schuko) are not designed for EV charging and cannot cope with recurrent high loads over time; therefore always limit charging to 8-10A and hang the control box from a hook.
Output
Why should you, as a tenant-owner associations, invest in an electric car charging system? And what should you think about?
An association can resolve to install EV charging at its general meeting. However, any decision should also be backed up with an assurance from the National Land Survey that the facility order includes EV charging. Without such an assurance, a member may subsequently dispute the decision and a court may annul it.
Over the past 12 months, the number of EVs has increased by more than 140 per cent in Sweden. Many people still believe that installing your own charger is complicated and expensive. But a great deal has happened technologically in recent years, making it both easier and cheaper to charge EVs at home.

Tenant-owner association
EVs rarely need to charge more than 2–3 hours. But in tenant-owner associations, they’re often parked for a long while, especially at night. Installing a charging box in every parking bay and maybe having to invest in a larger power supply cable from the mains is not particularly cost-effective.

Our innovative charging technology distributes available output from a central charging cabinet to the connected vehicles. Because charging is optimised for each EV’s parking time, charge requirement and battery capacity, up to 54 vehicles can share a single charging cabinet, and each vehicle can charge at up to 22 kW. What’s more, the system can be scaled up to hundreds of charging points.
An investment in EV charging adds value over the long term. Also, choosing a scalable solution makes scaling up easy when more people decide to drive EVs.

Thanks to our extensive experience in installing flexible, scalable charging systems, we can help you make the right choice. Our solution lets everyone in the association charge their cars without raising the property’s power rating. We raise the value of the property instead.
All you need to do to activate and control charging is download our app.
Your guests can also charge their cars. They use our app to activate and pay for charging. You decide if you want to add a surcharge to the electricity price.
Users control and pay for charging with our simple app. Property owners monitor and administer easily with our smart cloud service.
Charged with super smart steering
Our end-to-end solution includes planning, installation, operation and payment solutions, always with a 3-year warranty.
Increase the value of your association with fair, smart and scalable charging.
We’d love to tell you more.
Raise the value, not the power rating
Tenant-owner associations & jointly owned properties - ChargeNode
Andreas Tullberg
Brf Haga Nova
“ChargeNode’s centralized charging system provides efficient economies of scale, increased flexibility and is easy to expand as needs increase. Because the software optimizes charging per car based on, among other things, departure time and the number of connected cars, we were able to install 72 seats without having to upgrade other electrical infrastructure or electricity subscriptions.”
Meet more smart customers
The climate leap initiative allows associations a deduction of up to 50 per cent of the cost when you install EV chargers.

We can help you all the way through the application process.
Sounds pretty smart, eh?
App & cloud service
Our cloud service makes it easy for associations to provide access, monitor operations, see electricity consumption per user and bill them.
We can take care of all user billing. Users register their payment cards in our app and are then debited monthly or on each occasion they charge their vehicle. Easy peasy.

Choose between billing based on user consumption (number of kWh) and/or on a fixed price (standard) per month. If you prefer to look after billing yourself, invoice templates are available from our cloud service.
A supersmart and sustainable investment.

Enduring profitability
Our business is based on the use of nature’s resources in a smarter, more sustainable way. It’s in our DNA.
A fair and decent workplace
Close, long-term relationships
It means that our products must have long service lives, be frequently used and consume the fewest possible resources.
The best of both worlds
We believe in a fair and decent workplace. People who are happy at work have more energy and enthusiasm to contribute to our business.
For us, this means fair conditions regardless of gender, ethnicity and background. It also means a company culture in which we take care of each other, show respect and have a healthy balance between work and our private lives.
We’re very fortunate to work at ChargeNode as we have the world’s best job and also get to work for a more sustainable future society. And we would also like to share what sustainability means for us!
We strive to make sure our products will have a service life of at least 20 years. Our long-term approach also means we’re bold and willing enough to invest in good relations with everyone who means something to us i.e. our colleagues, suppliers, partners and customers. We believe this makes everything easier and more rewarding. It’s also a sustainable way to run a successful business.
The smarter way to use resources
When several people can share one charger, it takes less material and fewer components. Because we use components made from recycled materials of the highest quality to the greatest extent possible, and install them in a protected environment, we’re able to achieve maximum service life with a minimum of environmental impact.
Sustainability - ChargeNode
When you choose our products you’re making a climate-smart investment that helps achieve a better society. It also has to generate lasting profitability for us and for our customers.

What are your expectations when ChargeNode is launched on the Norwegian market?
With an electrical engineer degree and having spent the last 10 years in the EV charging industry, Frode brings a wealth of experience and will be a perfect fit as ChargeNode establish itself on the Norwegian market.
I look forward to inform the Norwegian market how ChargeNodes scalable charging technology can solve many challenges and enable more people to charge. I expect us to grow and become a significant player, just like in Sweden.
Finally time for Norway to charge in a smart way - ChargeNode
The industry is still fairly new and we probably do not see all the challenges yet. Even though we will see great development of energy efficient batteries, there will still be a huge need to charge. To avoid bottlenecks, we must charge when we can, not when we have to. With more and more electric cars, there must be more charging sockets. I also see a major challenge in leveling out energy consumption over a longer period of the day, which will help optimize the existing infrastructure. To meet these challenges, manufacturers and suppliers must be innovative.
The ChargeNode charging station, centrally located where all expensive and operational components are safely located, while type 2 sockets are installed at the parking lot. Other advantages are the simple app and charging portal that prioritizes the power in the system dynamically between 3 and 22kW to dedicated charging nodes prioritized according to departure needs and finally the simple payment methods combined with a solid service promise.
-When I started in the industry, there were not many electric cars, but when the authorities set goals for electrification of the Norwegian private car fleet for 2025, my interest grew. I have had the pleasure of following and shaping this journey, but it has been commercially challenging to design good solutions at the same pace as the market, technology and standards have developed. To find the best solutions for the domestic market, I have worked with many European manufacturers of both AC and DC solutions. It was when doing some international due diligence that ChargeNode turned up with an exciting mindset on how to meet the need for charging based on an energy-efficient, scalable and sustainable model with a number of advantages: The ability to use available energy in a smart way to charge as many electric cars as possible, opportunity for many charging socket without everyone needing a charging box. Material and aesthetic expression that lasts longer than other solutions. Low operating and ownership costs which guarantee a scalable facility long term. As ChargeNode develops its own software and hardware, we can ensure industry leading functionality and operational stability for users. In addition, we have innovative founders combined an experienced team in Sweden who put their heart and soul into the development of the product and the company. When I got the chance to join, it felt completely natural to follow this exciting journey.
There are both similarities and major differences between the Norwegian and Swedish markets. The biggest difference is probably the total electric car market and the sale of new cars. The market is more mature in Norway and a natural choice when buying a new car. If you combine electric cars and rechargeable hybrids, 22% of all cars in Norway and only 6% in Sweden are chargeable. This means that we have to solve the need for charging, at home, at work and on the roads, and that is not an easy task. I think the need in the Swedish and Norwegian markets is similar, Norway is only a few years ahead  in EV charging roll out. . Among other things, thanks to a favorable incentive program related to the purchase of electric vehicles, the use of electric cars and the establishment of an infrastructure for charging has seen Norway taking the lead globally with Sweden a few years behind.
What challenges do you see in the industry?
What will be the next step for the Norwegian market?
How big is the need for scalable EV charging in Norway?
It is important that we can quickly establish ourselves in Norway and inform the Norwegian market about ChargeNodes innovative and unique charging technology. We need to establish offices with more resources in sales while also building collaborations and partnerships in the market. We want to be a player with an active presence for our customers and partners in Norway.
Norway has the most electric cars per capita in the world, have you noticed any challenges with that?
We warmly welcome Frode Braaten as Sales & Country Manager for Norway!
Norway has become a kind of test market for everyone who has a solution for electric car use. All innovations are unfortunately not well designed or sustainable long term. Although Norway has a high density of electric cars, Norway is a small market with several challenges to address. We do not know how well solutions developed across the globe works in Norway. We also see that we have challenges related to the electric car density in urban areas, where today’s technology is unable to meet the demand for electric car charging.
Today, we have many 1st and 2nd generation solutions that no longer cover the need for todays EV charging and since our car fleet has an average age of over 10 years, the number of electric cars will continue to grow exponentially. I would argue that scalable electric car charging will be a key factor for the future if we want to continue grow at this pace and not overload the energy grid. The need is huge.
What is the difference between the Swedish and Norwegian markets?
What is best about ChargeNodes charging technology?

Blå Huset understood early on that there was a great need for EV charging, something that was also in line with the office block’s conscious environmental profile. It soon became an important issue.
Blå Huset is located in Lockarp just outside of Malmö. It is a newly built office block with the vision of being Malmö’s most modern, environmentally efficient office in an area characterised by burgeoning growth. It has had its challenges, ranging from the choice of materials to energy use and the ability of employees and visitors to the office to help reduce the long-term environmental impact. The building is owned by Blå Huset AB. One of the tenants is electricity installer APQ El AB, which naturally demands high standards of efficiency, user-friendliness and design.
“We’re aware of the impact we have on the environment and climate,” says Blå Huset’s Mattias Feldt. “Which is why it’s so important for us to stay ahead of the game. Within five years, 80% of company vehicles will almost certainly be hybrid or EVs. It’s also why we chose to install 53 charging sockets with integrated outlets in our car park. By making EV charging available in as many parking bays as possible, we will enable customers to avoid moving their cars around during working hours.”

Offering charging points is a no-brainer
“The work from contract to system commissioning with various design solutions for charging EVs went very smoothly,” continued Mattias. “Something our customers appreciate. Our customer portal gives us a good overview, and our employees and visitors find the app very easy to use. We’ve future-proofed things in a pretty smart way. Offering many charging points will be a must in the future. People will take EV charging at workplaces for granted. This means electricity companies will have to expand their networks, which is a challenge.”
